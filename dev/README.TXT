SOME INFO ABOUT THE GAME

"Xenocide the roguelike" is a single-player game that uses
ASCII (text) graphics. It looks similar in appearance
to ADOM, NetHack or Crawl, the main difference being
the world in which the game is set.
In Xenocide you won't find goblins, magic or knights
- the action takes place in the future.

You can move player character with numeric keypad
- make sure that NumLock is on.
(1-9 are directions, 5 is wait command).
To gain info about other commands - press '?'.
Keyboard can be defined in data/keyboard.def.

The game is still in development, so don't expect stability.

If the game runs slow, you are probalby running Windows version.
The slowness is caused by Windows port of PDCurses.
Try the DOS version (it works fine under W9x/ME/2K/XP).

Thanks:
- to Stephen Pasquella for new monster descriptions, ideas
  and help with my English language.
- to Antti Hukkanen for new item descriptions, bug reports
  and interesting discussion about the game.

I'm looking forward for your comments.

regards
Jakub
