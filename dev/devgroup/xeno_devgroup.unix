Long time, no write, guys. I know that you've all been busy, as have I, but I 
figured I'd end the silence here by sending up a small idea related to the 
skills system which Jakub is planning on working on next.

I had an idea of how a skills-only (or mostly skills-only) system could be 
made to work so that players don't end up with all of their skills maxed out and 
able to do everything perfectly. I think this solution is (if I don't say so 
myself) quite simple.

Namely, every time a player increases a skill past a certain point, it 
becomes harder for him to increase other skills beyond that point as well. This 
effect would not be noticeable at lower skill levels (you could skill be 'alright' 
at most skills with some work), but it would be virtually impossible to get 
more than one or two skills to the 'perfect' kind of level. This would be done 
on the principle that the brain can only hold so much information, and how the 
more we learn the harder it is for us to learn new things.

Allow me to give an example. Let us say Xenocide ends up using a skill 
system, on a scale from 1 to 10 (with 1 being horrible, 10 being near perfect, and 0 
being nonexistent).

Let us say I raise my hypothetical "culinary arts" skill from level 1 to 
level 2. This would make it so that it would become slightly harder to raise my 
other skills to level 2. Of course, seeing as how 2 is such a low skill level, 
it is still very easy to attain it, the requirement to increase my other skills 
going up only one or two points. In fact, this increase in requirement would 
probably be unnoticeable unless I got an inordinate number of my other skills 
up to level 2, and even then it would probably be a slight increase (perhaps 
said requirement increases are capped for lower levels of skill).

However, when I start getting skills up to level 7 and 8 (probably something 
like 'fantastic' and 'phenomenal'), the requirement increase becomes more 
drastic. This is done so that the player can reasonably attain only a certain 
number of skills per game, so that I don't have them all at level 7, but I can 
still get a certain number to them up to said level.

Hence, it might be reasonable to get 25% of all available skills to level 7, 
before the required training to increase more skills to 7 would become so 
steep that I would have to go far out of my way to get them up to said level.

Of course, I could still train at another skill relentlessly, and raise it 
above 7, but it would take lots of time, and then it will be even harder to 
increase a skill beyond 7 again.

This way, a player would only be able to get, say one or two skills up to 
level 10, before it became impractical to do so any more. Now, if he wanted to 
waste whole years of his time then he could, in theory, max out all his skills, 
just as perhaps a person could in real life. But the requirement for 
increasing skills to level 10 would have, by that time, gone so far up that he would 
take literally years of his playing time just to accomplish this feat. So the 
average player, who has an actual life, wouldn't be able to do this.

Now, using such a system raises some concerns. One is that, what happens if I 
accidentally increase a certain skill above a certain level without meaning 
to? What if I'm just using my pistol to preserve my life and don't mean to 
increase my skills with it, saving instead my skills for things like science and 
medicine?

I think the simplest solution to this problem is to make it so the player can 
disable training in certain skills, kind of like in Crawl. This way, a player 
could use his skills all he wants, but not bother to learn from his mistakes 
and successes, and hence raise only those skill which he wishes to.

The other obvious solution to this problem is making it so that skills that 
are used more often, like weapons skills, are harder to level up that things 
not used as often. This might seem unfair to players who usually take the 
commando approach to Xenocide (such as myself), but they would be using their 
weapons more than anyone else, so they would increase their weapon skills about as 
fast.

So, I think that would work out said concern. I know that there must be other 
problems with said system, especially those of balancing it all out, but I'll 
wait until you guys respond (if you see fit to respond :) before I say 
anything more.

Anyway, I hope everyone out there on the other side of the Atlantic is doing 
alright.

God bless,

- Steve

>You aren't bothered by ASCII graphics. I thought playing roguelike
>games teaches to ignore graphics..


But I LIKE the ASCII graphics in rogue likes. Or, perhaps, I like the fact 
that they allow a great deal of flexibility along with simplicity and a small 
file size :)

And, upon downloading and playing LL again, I've found that the graphics 
aren't as bad as I remember (the last time I played it, it was a while ago, so I 
didn't have that clear of a memory of it). What bothered me the most was the 
low resolution, but I just played it in windowed mode.

I must say, Laby, for all its simplicity, is a real fun game. Perhaps it goes 
to show that, in a roguelike, complexity is not the same as depth.

>>I do like the 
>> fact that you cannot  move diagonally, though.

>Strange. Can you explain ?


Yes, actually, I can.

It has always bothered me to some small degree that in a roguelike you can 
move diagonally, as well as vertically and horizontally, even though on a grid a 
diagonal distance is longer than a non-diagonal one. Also, I've always found 
it strange how in a situation like this:

#...
.#..
.@#.
...#

The player could move up and to the right, going right between two of the 
blocks, even though their corners are touching.

Not that moving diagonally bothers me in Xenocide. I think that the 
introduction of animate graphics to a game, like those found in LL, would make moving 
diagonally hard to express pictorially. Also, if the enemies were animated, and 
could move as well, then diagonal motions would *really* make it hard to have 
graphics without the various little figures passing through one another in a 
really cheap way.

So, yes, I like no diagonal movements in Laby. But not in Xenocide. Unless, 
of course, Xenocide were to have animated graphics :)

Well, you could always increase the effectiveness of an implant (a 
strength-increasing implant would give a bigger strength boost), and there could be 
different kinds of upgrades that help the implant function better (uses less 
power, protected from EMPs, more resistant to damage, etc.).

Well, I do think that mowing down an entire field of Genotroids and Super 
Genotroids should yield some distinct reward. Maybe a skill increase? Maybe lots 
of cool items and weapons? Maybe taking your fallen enemy's skulls as trophies 
(should be implemented :)? Yet it would make a lot of sense if killing only 
increased your killing ability, and not the rest of them.

So, perhaps a level-free, classless system is the way to go, after all.

Exactly. So you can start off as a combat character and gradually move your 
focus more onto technological matters.

Try a spriggan assassin or stalker. You can shoot poison darts at enemies 
(with your blowgun), and then run away, the spriggan being the fastest race in 
the game and capable of out running most monsters (even snakes on the early 
levels). When the monster dies of poison, you get XP, even if you're half a level 
away by then >:)

I've had some luck with such characters. Until I run out of needles...

Well, I think monsters should respawn. This gives players wanting to 
backtrack across one area of the game to the next something to do other than just 
walking. Respawning could always be turned down much lower, of course, but in 
certain places (like the living level) it would probably make more sense to have 
monsters have a rather high respawn rate.

Also, it could be that, similar to the weapon skills in ADOM, a steep 
learning curve could require so much work to master a skill that to master them all 
would be possible, but would take more time than is humanly possible.

In addition, like in ADOM, one can only get so much experience from killing a 
rat. After that, he ceases to learn anything new.

Well, we don't want implants to be too powerful. There should probably be 
drawbacks to use them, such as needing a greater energy source, and the hampering 
of the natural growth of your stats (a muscular implant give immense 
artificial strength but limits the amount of natural muscle tissue available for use 
without the implant). They should also add weight to the player, which can slow 
him down and limit his carrying capacity if he goes too implant-crazy.

Also, it should not be mandatory to use implants. Someone like me might use 
implants sometimes. But I can't see myself always using them. And there should, 
I think, be other systems that the player can use should that be what he 
want. As in, he could use implants to give him an added edge, or he could 
genetics, or he could use items, or just do things the old fashion way and become 
really good at shooting things :)

>Now you're scaring me. I'd like camping to be viable to a certain
>point. For as long as safety permits.


Well, my point was that staying put too long for a time might stand the 
chance to put the player in a horrible, horrible situation. Like the time that I, 
playing ADOM , ended up allowing an army of red worms to breed in such large 
numbers that I could scarcely kill them all even with a wand of ice. I was 
eventually done in by a very experienced worm, the Achilles of an army of Myrmidons 
(who, if my classical memory serves me right, were formed from ants; not 
worms). Not that, if the player sat around for too long, that his destruction 
would be *assured*. But he still might end up dying.

Oh, how I agree. Wasn't going to say much about this until the new skill 
system was implemented (Jakub has enough to worry about with that, IMHO), but not 
that it's been brought up...

How to say this? After a point it becomes boring to bash your way through an 
army of enemies that pose little, or no, threat to you. It would be different 
if ranged weapons were somewhat more reliable, but unless you have an 
automatic rifle, it isn't, and even then there's no guarantee that you'll hit 
anything, and your ammo tends to evaporate. And even if it were more reliable...

>What I like about DoomRL is that you can actually kill monsters before

Then we would just be walking around shooting at enemies who were still way 
too easy to kill. So...

This, I think, would spice things up a bit, with certain provisions. Pistols 
should certainly be much more powerful than wrenches. Rifles should be a lot 
more stronger than pistols (though heavier, more kickback, etc. so that it's 
more balanced, even if the rifles still do more damage). And more advanced melee 
weapons, whether powered [chainsaws, vibro-swords, light-sabres] or 
non-powered [super-sharp bayonets made from a special high-tech metal, spears made from 
ultra-sharp crystal that are very good at piercing armour but which break 
easier than most weapons, swords whose core is made from a special 
electro-magnetically charged substance that amplifies the amount of weight put behind them 
by a lot but weighs quite a bit, etc.] should do damage greater than pistols 
and (for some) greater than rifles, the drawback being that you have to get in 
close to your enemy to hurt him (which is not hard if you have a lot of armour 
and your own enemy cannot attack at a distance, but is more difficult if your 
foe is shooting at you while you try to get him close enough to kill).

So, yes, ranged weapons should be more accurate (especially the nail guns... 
not much kickback to those, I'd imagine), and do more damage. It would be nice 
if there were more ammo, too, so that they player can use his gun more often. 
A wider diversity of pickup items, found at random on enemies, could help, 
too.

Now, as for monster attacks, I think they could stand to do much more damage 
in melee than the player can. Most of the enemies in Xenocide are either 
animals, robots, or crazy humans. Animals, as a rule, tend to be stronger than 
humans, or at least they are so feral that its strength becomes amplified several 
fold. You know, how dogs can snap bones with a snap of their jaws and year the 
flesh off of a human face. Robots, of course, tend to have hydraulic or 
magnetic powered limbs, which they use to tear people to shreds and consume their 
flesh, using it as a crude fuel to power their deathrays. And crazy humans tend 
to be about as dangerous as wild animals, and they can use weapons as well.

I would also think that it could help to give more monsters ranged attacks, 
as well as to make more distinctions between one monster and another. One thing 
I've noticed is, especially on the earlier levels of the space shuttle, the 
claw rat, prankster, star crawler, etc. don't seem all that different from one 
another. It would be nice if all of the monsters on the shuttle could be 
different from one another in a variety of ways, other than just stats.

So, in summary, I think that to spice up the combat a bit that we need (tell 
me what you think of this, won't you?):

* Ranged combat to be made more accurate (might not be all that realistic, 
but game play always trumps realism in terms of priories).
* Pistols to do a lot more damage, and rifles to do even more.
* A somewhat wider availability of ammo, so that ranged weapons can be used 
more often.
* More devices / items.
* Tougher enemies that can take more punishment, as well as dish out more 
pain.
* Enemies that are more widely diversified.

Speaking of such enemies, I was thinking about some of the monsters on the 
shuttle, and maybe which ones could be changed to be different enough from one 
another, as well as making there more foes with ranged attacks.

Now I think that all enemies, as said before, need to be able to take more 
damage, as well as deal more damage out. That being said...

Claw Rat: I think that, aside from increasing this creature's strength and HP 
a bit that it still serves as a nice sort of "starter" enemy to stick in the 
early sections of the game to teach the player how to kill things.

Flying Leech: I would strongly recommend keeping this creature, as an 
annoyance enemy. It would be nice if it could regenerate its wounds faster, too, just 
to make it somewhat tougher (not that it's all that hard to kill)

Small Critter: These things, I'm thinking, should be very weak and very 
quick, but gain strength from usually appearing in small groups of 3-5 (at the very 
least).

Rabid Prankster: I was thinking... What if the prankster was less of a tough 
primate and more of a... prankster? A quick moving, somewhat hard to hit, 
capable of stealing items from the player and then running away. In other words, a 
really annoying monster.

Crazy Doctor: The same as the crazy scientist now in the game, this guy has 
pills and will sometimes have the armour powered scalpel (not powered).

Crazy Chemist: A guy with a dart gun >:) Darts tend to do very little damage, 
but contain some kind of toxin that affects the player's status somehow.

Crazy Scientist: A scientist with several devices, be they grenades or 
force-fields or hologram projectors or something else.

Crazy Mechanic: A tough guy who is often is possession of a nail pistol and a 
good deal of nails, which he can be quite formidable with. He also tends to 
carry damaged robot parts.

Crazy Security Guard: The rarest and toughest of all the crazies aboard the 
ship, he has light armour and a gun, with several clips of ammo. He sometimes 
carries some kind of as of yet unimplemented nightstick, too, for the bashing 
in of heads.

Lightbug: A flying insect that is capable of shooting tiny bolts of 
electricity at the player. This creature is relatively weak, but it prefers to keep its 
distance from its enemies, circling them and zapping them from afar. If you 
can corner it, it's good as dead.

Pyrosaur: A small, dragon-looking lizard that is capable of spitting a 
relatively powerful blast of fire over very short ranges, like an organic 
flamethrower. The best thing with this beast is to kill it from a distance, because if 
you get too close, you'll get burned.

Black Beetle: This thing should be made a lot tougher in melee combat, and 
made very good at shredding armour to bits. Being so slow, it is a good idea to 
make it do more damage to the player when it finally catches up with him. 
Also, I was thinking that the nails could stand do be a little better at piercing 
this thing's armour (I think, by the way, that this should be renamed the 
"Butcher Beetle").

Leaper: A nasty, lizard-like, wolf-sized creature capable of "jumping" across 
long distances (teleporting over ground and enemies but not over walls). It 
can leap toward the player to attack, and leap away to escape (but it can only 
leap so often). If it lands next to the player while leaping, it can perform 
an attack worth double (or triple?) damage.

Well, that's it. What'd you think? I still have no idea what to say about the 
star crawler, stain worm, et cetera...

It might be a good idea for us to list all of the possible enemies of every 
zone here and go back and forth discussing them before we start implementing 
them, as has already been done. That way we might be able to come up with a more 
balanced playing field.

>Imagine that a nasty monster needs two shotgun hits to die.... with

>I guess it's no problem for characters focusing heavily on combat, but

Or every point could increase your chance to do more damage / hit the enemy a 
bit. For example, pistols at skill 20 might give you, um, 20% added damage to 
hit. At 21, +21% to hit. Or, if 20 is +%2 to critical, then 21 is +%2.1, or 
something.

Of course, the player will most likely have to shoot something at some time, 
even if he's just making a fighting retreat.

>Oh, and by the way - barrels are really mean in DoomRL. But the game
>overall is too easy,

I got to the cyber demon twice. But... I don't find it all that easy :(

I keep getting killed by some @!#$ hell knight. Or by my own rockets :)

Anyway, DooM RL is fun, and I think we can learn a lot from it. Let's just 
avoid making Xenocide a DRL clone.

And now I must away. I have more ideas but... they're too many to write in 
this small space.

God Bless,

<DIV><FONT face="Courier New"></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face="Courier New">Here we go...<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&gt;(LL)<BR><BR>&gt;You aren't bothered by ASCII graphics. I thought playing roguelike<BR>&gt;games teaches to ignore graphics..<BR><BR><BR>But I LIKE the ASCII graphics in rogue likes. Or, perhaps, I like the fact that they allow a great deal of flexibility along with simplicity and a small file size :)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>And, upon downloading and playing LL again, I've found that the graphics aren't as bad as I remember (the last time I played it, it was a while ago, so I didn't have that clear of a memory of it). What bothered me the most was the low resolution, but I just played it in windowed mode.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I must say, Laby, for all its simplicity, is a real fun game. Perhaps it goes to show that, in a roguelike, complexity is not the same as depth.<BR><BR>&gt;&gt;I do like the <BR>&gt;&gt; fact that you cannot&nbsp; move diagonally, though.<BR><BR>&gt;Strange. Can you explain ?<BR><BR><BR>Yes, actually, I can.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>It has always bothered me to some small degree that in a roguelike you can move diagonally, as well as vertically and horizontally, even though on a grid a diagonal distance is longer than a non-diagonal one. Also, I've always found it strange how in a situation like this:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>#...<BR>.#..<BR>.@#.<BR>...#<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The player could move up and to the right, going right between two of the blocks, even though their corners are touching.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Not that moving diagonally bothers me in Xenocide. I think that the introduction of animate graphics to a game, like those found in LL, would make moving diagonally hard to express pictorially. Also, if the enemies were animated, and could move as well, then diagonal motions would *really* make it hard to have graphics without the various little figures passing through one another in a really cheap way.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>So, yes, I like no diagonal movements in Laby. But not in Xenocide. Unless, of course, Xenocide were to have animated graphics :)<BR><BR>&gt;That's basically how I would like implants to work in Xenocide, except<BR>&gt;for two things:<BR>&gt;1) There should be much more than 2 implants to choose from (per canister)<BR>&gt;2) I'm not sure about whole implant upgrading idea. LL works without<BR>&gt;trait upgrades, and most of them are useful for entire game. They<BR>&gt;depend on your stats. Or simply they offer something not possible<BR>&gt;without traits. What exactly can be accomplished with upgrading implants ?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Well, you could always increase the effectiveness of an implant (a strength-increasing implant would give a bigger strength boost), and there could be different kinds of upgrades that help the implant function better (uses less power, protected from EMPs, more resistant to damage, etc.).<BR><BR>&gt;With exp4kill, Xenocide is about killing, not<BR>&gt;survival, actually. I heard it's supposed to be a survival game. So<BR>&gt;reward surviving :-). As if being alive for a bit longer wasn't nice<BR>&gt;enough ;-).<BR><BR><BR>Well, I do think that mowing down an entire field of Genotroids and Super Genotroids should yield some distinct reward. Maybe a skill increase? Maybe lots of cool items and weapons? Maybe taking your fallen enemy's skulls as trophies (should be implemented :)? Yet it would make a lot of sense if killing only increased your killing ability, and not the rest of them.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>So, perhaps a level-free, classless system is the way to go, after all.<BR><BR>&gt;&gt; Though perhaps&nbsp; classes would still be good to have, as starting<BR>&gt;&gt; templates <BR>&gt;&gt; that give the player&nbsp; a few bonus stats and his equipment.<BR><BR>&gt;I agree. I started playing Dungeon Crawl, and classes seem to affect<BR>&gt;only your starting skills/abilities there. And it's not like choice<BR>&gt;doesn't matter anymore.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Exactly. So you can start off as a combat character and gradually move your focus more onto technological matters.<BR><BR>&gt;(Side note - all characters seem bloody hard to play, except for<BR>&gt;fighters/gladiators and trolls. I reached the temple only once per 20<BR>&gt;tries with my human Earth Elementalist. No, I don't like to play<BR>&gt;treehuggers.)<BR><BR><BR>Try a spriggan assassin or stalker. You can shoot poison darts at enemies (with your blowgun), and then run away, the spriggan being the fastest race in the game and capable of out running most monsters (even snakes on the early levels). When the monster dies of poison, you get XP, even if you're half a level away by then &gt;:)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I've had some luck with such characters. Until I run out of needles...<BR><BR>&gt;&gt; to advance past a&nbsp; certain point. If one is very skilled with<BR>&gt;&gt; rifles, and <BR>&gt;&gt; wants to increase his&nbsp; skills, he will have to not only use his<BR>&gt;&gt; rifle, but use it <BR>&gt;&gt; often. If he&nbsp; alternates between using a pistol and a rifle, he<BR>&gt;&gt; won't advance <BR>&gt;&gt; very much. He&nbsp; would have to practice that one skill to the<BR>&gt;&gt; exclusion of most <BR>&gt;&gt; others, which can&nbsp; be hard in a combat zone. <BR><BR>&gt;Or another solution - turn off monster respawning. Like in Crawl,<BR>&gt;where monsters almost don't respawn after clearing a level. What I<BR>&gt;like about that in Crawl is that it feels quite fair - once you clear<BR>&gt;some rooms, they pretty much stay clear. And you can plan using that<BR>&gt;knowledge (you can run that way to retreat, for example).<BR>&gt;Then again, Crawl has food so you can't camp one zone for years. Hmm,<BR>&gt;but mummies don't need food. So I guess you could camp forever on easy<BR>&gt;zone as an undead, it would just be booooooring with Crawl's slow<BR>&gt;respawn rate. <BR><BR><BR>Well, I think monsters should respawn. This gives players wanting to backtrack across one area of the game to the next something to do other than just walking. Respawning could always be turned down much lower, of course, but in certain places (like the living level) it would probably make more sense to have monsters have a rather high respawn rate.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Also, it could be that, similar to the weapon skills in ADOM, a steep learning curve could require so much work to master a skill that to master them all would be possible, but would take more time than is humanly possible.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>In addition, like in ADOM, one can only get so much experience from killing a rat. After that, he ceases to learn anything new.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&gt;I'm a bit worried about class solution. No magic (unless you want to<BR>&gt;implement PSI, I hope you don't) can limit character freedom.<BR>&gt;How much original classes can you design and balance ? I'd rather see<BR>&gt;overgrown implant system filling this role :-). You can be much more<BR>&gt;creative if your characters are modular.<BR><BR><BR>Well, we don't want implants to be too powerful. There should probably be drawbacks to use them, such as needing a greater energy source, and the hampering of the natural growth of your stats (a muscular implant give immense artificial strength but limits the amount of natural muscle tissue available for use without the implant). They should also add weight to the player, which can slow him down and limit his carrying capacity if he goes too implant-crazy.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Also, it should not be mandatory to use implants. Someone like me might use implants sometimes. But I can't see myself always using them. And there should, I think, be other systems that the player can use should that be what he want. As in, he could use implants to give him an added edge, or he could genetics, or he could use items, or just do things the old fashion way and become really good at shooting things :)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&gt;Now you're scaring me. I'd like camping to be viable to a certain<BR>&gt;point. For as long as safety permits.<BR><BR><BR>Well, my point was that staying put too long for a time might stand the chance to put the player in a horrible, horrible situation. Like the time that I, playing ADOM , ended up allowing an army of red worms to breed in such large numbers that I could scarcely kill them all even with a wand of ice. I was eventually done in by a very experienced worm, the Achilles of an army of Myrmidons (who, if my classical memory serves me right, were formed from ants; not worms). Not that, if the player sat around for too long, that his destruction would be *assured*. But he still might end up dying.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>[DooM RL]<BR><BR>&gt;That's what Xenocide lacks at the moment. Dynamic combat. Sure it's<BR>&gt;extreme in DoomRL, but same goes for Xenocide where combat often comes<BR>&gt;down to melee and who can regenerate hp faster. (Red centipedes !).<BR><BR><BR>Oh, how I agree. Wasn't going to say much about this until the new skill system was implemented (Jakub has enough to worry about with that, IMHO), but not that it's been brought up...<BR>&nbsp;<BR>How to say this? After a point it becomes boring to bash your way through an army of enemies that pose little, or no, threat to you. It would be different if ranged weapons were somewhat more reliable, but unless you have an automatic rifle, it isn't, and even then there's no guarantee that you'll hit anything, and your ammo tends to evaporate. And even if it were more reliable...<BR><BR>&gt;What I like about DoomRL is that you can actually kill monsters before<BR>&gt;they reach you - and many of them are mean up close.<BR><BR><BR>Then we would just be walking around shooting at enemies who were still way too easy to kill. So...<BR><BR>&gt;I think speeding up the combat (basically incresing damage dealt by<BR>&gt;all, including player) would benefit Xenocide. Not as fast as in<BR>&gt;DoomRL, but combat feels sluggish now. And ranged weaponry is totally<BR>&gt;unreliable.<BR><BR><BR>This, I think, would spice things up a bit, with certain provisions. Pistols should certainly be much more powerful than wrenches. Rifles should be a lot more stronger than pistols (though heavier, more kickback, etc. so that it's more balanced, even if the rifles still do more damage). And more advanced melee weapons, whether powered [chainsaws, vibro-swords, light-sabres] or non-powered [super-sharp bayonets made from a special high-tech metal, spears made from ultra-sharp crystal that are very good at piercing armour but which break easier than most weapons, swords whose core is made from a special electro-magnetically charged substance that amplifies the amount of weight put behind them by a lot but weighs quite a bit, etc.] should do damage greater than pistols and (for some) greater than rifles, the drawback being that you have to get in close to your enemy to hurt him (which is not hard if you have a lot of armour and your own enemy cannot attack at a distance, but is more difficult if your foe is shooting at you while you try to get him close enough to kill).<BR>&nbsp;<BR>So, yes, ranged weapons should be more accurate (especially the nail guns... not much kickback to those, I'd imagine), and do more damage. It would be nice if there were more ammo, too, so that they player can use his gun more often. A wider diversity of pickup items, found at random on enemies, could help, too.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Now, as for monster attacks, I think they could stand to do much more damage in melee than the player can. Most of the enemies in Xenocide are either animals, robots, or crazy humans. Animals, as a rule, tend to be stronger than humans, or at least they are so feral that its strength becomes amplified several fold. You know, how dogs can snap bones with a snap of their jaws and year the flesh off of a human face. Robots, of course, tend to have hydraulic or magnetic powered limbs, which they use to tear people to shreds and consume their flesh, using it as a crude fuel to power their deathrays. And crazy humans tend to be about as dangerous as wild animals, and they can use weapons as well.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I would also think that it could help to give more monsters ranged attacks, as well as to make more distinctions between one monster and another.

You aren't bothered by ASCII graphics. I thought playing roguelike
games teaches to ignore graphics..

I do like the

Strange. Can you explain ?
 
> Also, no line of  sight = bad, IMHO. 

Sure it's bad, I guess the author made it this way because it was easier.
Line of sight exists to a point - you can't cast spells past walls,
boulders (there was a bug which allowed casting through boulders)...

But now implementing LOS is not an option for that game, really. Many
spells benefit a lot from no LOS. You can make thief-like spellcasting
character, focusing on spells like Portal, Earth Ripple, Teleport,
Vanish... These would suffer from LOS and provide yet another playing
style.

Of course no LOS isn't very good for Xenocide. Some high-tech
equipment, perhaps, but not all the time.

> I like this idea  for the implant system. It reminds me of the FPS
"Dues Ex", 

I finished Deus Ex two times or so. You don't need to explain.

That's basically how I would like implants to work in Xenocide, except
for two things:
1) There should be much more than 2 implants to choose from (per canister)
2) I'm not sure about whole implant upgrading idea. LL works without
trait upgrades, and most of them are useful for entire game. They
depend on your stats. Or simply they offer something not possible
without traits. What exactly can be accomplished with upgrading implants ?

possible and

My point exactly. With exp4kill, Xenocide is about killing, not
survival, actually. I heard it's supposed to be a survival game. So
reward surviving :-). As if being alive for a bit longer wasn't nice
enough ;-).
Anyway, System Shock 2 gives no exp for kills, and we all seem to
agree that it's very nice - and moody - survival game. Only
progress/exploration is rewarded in SS2.

> Though perhaps  classes would still be good to have, as starting
templates 
> that give the player  a few bonus stats and his equipment.

I agree. I started playing Dungeon Crawl, and classes seem to affect
only your starting skills/abilities there. And it's not like choice
doesn't matter anymore.
(Side note - all characters seem bloody hard to play, except for
fighters/gladiators and trolls. I reached the temple only once per 20
tries with my human Earth Elementalist. No, I don't like to play
treehuggers.)

Or another solution - turn off monster respawning. Like in Crawl,
where monsters almost don't respawn after clearing a level. What I
like about that in Crawl is that it feels quite fair - once you clear
some rooms, they pretty much stay clear. And you can plan using that
knowledge (you can run that way to retreat, for example).
Then again, Crawl has food so you can't camp one zone for years. Hmm,
but mummies don't need food. So I guess you could camp forever on easy
zone as an undead, it would just be booooooring with Crawl's slow
respawn rate.

I'm a bit worried about class solution. No magic (unless you want to
implement PSI, I hope you don't) can limit character freedom.
How much original classes can you design and balance ? I'd rather see
overgrown implant system filling this role :-). You can be much more
creative if your characters are modular.

Now you're scaring me. I'd like camping to be viable to a certain

About Doom the Roguelike

That's what Xenocide lacks at the moment. Dynamic combat. Sure it's
extreme in DoomRL, but same goes for Xenocide where combat often comes
down to melee and who can regenerate hp faster. (Red centipedes !).

What I like about DoomRL is that you can actually kill monsters before
they reach you - and many of them are mean up close.

I think speeding up the combat (basically incresing damage dealt by
all, including player) would benefit Xenocide. Not as fast as in
DoomRL, but combat feels sluggish now. And ranged weaponry is totally
unreliable.

Only problem I can see with that is that it could be potentially
harder to balance. 

Imagine that a nasty monster needs two shotgun hits to die.... with
skill 10. Now at skill 20 you need only one shot to kill it.
I guess it's no problem for characters focusing heavily on combat, but
how about more balanced ones ? I mean, they my try to increase guns
skill a bit, and anything between 10 and 20 would feel pointless,
because that nasty thing needs two shots to die anyway.
One solution would be some randomness. For example with with skill 12
you'd have 80% chance to kill it in two shots, and 20$ for one shot kill.

Oh, and by the way - barrels are really mean in DoomRL. But the game
overall is too easy, or perhaps some weapons are unballanced. Several
level without even getting hit once... And shotguns are pretty poor
for stronger monsters. Chaingun+Rocket Launcher and you're set until a
bug kills you.

Don't forget that  it should be harder to advance any skill beyond a certai=

Should probably be  drawback to using implants. Also, some stronger implant=

side effects (e.g. the  player gets an insane boost of strength, but he=20

sub-machineguns.=20

Actually, I thought  the same way for a while. But now I rather like the=20
system Xenocide  has.=20
Because, as Jakub  once said, food is really an incentive to move the playe=

Hey

I've been playing Lost Labyrinth for a while now, and despite its
shortcomings (monsters don't move at all ! No line of sight ! Can't
move diagonally) other roguelike games have MUCH to learn from it.

It's deceptively simple at first, yet it's simplicity allows for
awesome freedom in character generation. No concept of class, because
no one needs classes there. There can be many, many different
characters and each of them needs another tactic.
It's also one of few games where Thief is a viable option ! You see,
there's practically no thief in ADOM. You have stealth, backstabbing,
trap detection and disarming in ADOM, .... SO WHAT ? You need to kill
to advance anyway !

In Lost Labyrinth, you don't need to. In fact, there's little to be
gained from killing. You get some items, but many items are there
anyway. With certain traits (mutually exclusive) you can get extra
maximum hp or mp for kills. That's not a lot compared to other
Roguelike games.

Exp in Laby is gained by entering a new level. Character level is
almost the same as labyrinth level.
 And you know what ? It's fantastic for gameplay, you can experiment
with countless traits and make soo funny characters...

I imagine that implants in Xenocide would work much like traits in
Lost Labyrinth. But in LL traits are chosen at character generation (7
, possibly more if you take some negative traits).

Back to Xenocide: if implants work just like "cursed" items which are
stuck in your inventory, that's not good. They'll be just that - items
to be found. I suggest something that provides much more freedom of
choice:
For example instead of finding/unlocking invidual implants, you'd be
able to unlock at least several at a time, but you can only choose 1
implant per slot anyway. Play Lost Labyrinth, freedom of choice is
what makes it a wonderful game ! If implant system is extended (let's
forget "it still needs to be implemented" kind of details for now;-)
to something close to Lost Labyrinth... there won't be any need for
artificial things like character classes, it wll happen automagically.
And Xenocide will rule supreme.
-----------------------


Another thing: you may easily think I lost my mind, but I'd love to
see Xenocide with NO EXP FOR KILLS at all. Simply because it supports
many non-combat characters, like thieves. Such a simple solution, and
it allows unbelievable freedom in character development, trust me.

1) I think that fighting should still be the best way to develop
combat skills. Combat skills should be raised by use.
2) I suggest that general experience is acquired simply by exploring
new areas. That's what you esentially do anyway in all roguelikes - if
you want to raise your characters in levels and find interesting
items. I suggest static experience gain per level explored, and
dangerous levels would provide more experience.
You could still camp one zone as long as you wanted to, but you could
only raise skills by use that way.

Two more issues:
a) Someone may be bothered by fact that you could gain skills by use
infinitely. Well, there can be mechanisms like progressively less
skill gain for killing same creatures over and over. Or another
thing:skill increase per level would be capped. So after certain point
you'd have to visit other areas (to see new monsters and learn new
tricks from them) in order to advance. Quite natural if you ask me.
b) Most roguelikes have mechanisms to prevent raising skills by use
without valid "target". For example in ADOM you can only cast certain
spell X times before you forget it. I believe it was implemented
becasue spell effectiveness raises with each cast - to prevent abuse.

For Xenocide, for solution I outlined above, I suggest something
different. For example, you could raise your Rifles skill by shooting
at creatures to level 60, or you could raise it to 20 by shooting
outside of combat. It makes sense that you can practice shooting with
static targets (no enemies), but yuo shouldn't expect to learn as much
as with moving (and attacking!) targets.
Then you'd need to increase your character level to increase the cap.

If someone has ammo to waste, and doesn't mind monsters attracted by
gunshots, let him to practice using static targets ! He won't learn
that much and ammo isn't that plentiful.

What do you think ?

I strongly recommend playing Lost Labirynth before repplying. You may
not understand me otherwise. 
http://laby.toybox.de/index.php3?sprache=1

To summarize:
- I'd like Xenocide to have huge implant system, very good class/magic
substitute, offers much freedom
- I'd like to see exp for kill rule dropped in Xenocide. It allows
non-combat characters, and much more freedom in general. Of course,
such characters are in trouble if something gets close enough.
-----------------

Another thing: I'm not sure about Xenocide's "no food needed" thing.
One of reasons:
What prevents a player from holing up somewhere, locking a door, and
waiting until he's healed ? No food requirement...
Ok, so monsters heal even if you leave a level, but if you can handle
at least one at a time, you'll finally get past almost any monster.

Lost Labyrinth has food, thirst, lightsources management (light
matters a lot in that game) and managed to balance it.

Hi,

thanks a lot guys for your wishes.
Yesterday I played a bit with the source code of Xenocide, and the
result is simple game
http://www.alamak0ta.republika.pl/bomberogue.html
Give it a try if you like :)

>>But please, remember that Xenocide is NOT dead! Your efforts won't be
>>useless: Xenocide is my dreamed project and I will finnish it for sure.
> Well that's good to hear!

Well, I'm sure that during the next half year I'll work about the
game, but I do not give any promises.
Sometimes I just feel urge to create something :)

> Also, Jakub, you don't mind if we still discuss ideas for Xenocide here?

Sure :)
I read all your emails, even if I don't answer back. They are very interesting :)
I really admire your creativity!

I'll try to convince Gilus to reactive Xenocide's website. A positive
feedback works very stimulating for the author.

>>Hope that you're not angry with me.
> Oh, no, I'm not angry with you.  Duty comes before recreation, right? And you
> have your work to do, so do it :)

I'm trying :) Who know wher it will lead me.
I've got a job offer from Slovakia and from Finland beeing on
conference in Chicago, so... who knows... :)
Maybe I'll knock Antti's door and ask if the cheap beer that I took with me
is drinkable ;)

> Besides, Xenocide is your project. Even if you abandoned it I wouldn't be

I'd be disappointed as well :)

> I'm still happy to hear that Xenocide is *not* dead, though :D

:)

> Besides, I've been playing ADOM for a while now. We ADOM players sometimes
> have to wait years for a new version of ADOM.

Yeah, I have the same problem as Thomas - give me a few million $$$
and I'll work only on my game... If I had more luck, I'd start to play
in loterries, but... well... I don't have ;)

> Anyway, I wish you luck with life,

thanks :)

btw: Marek - Ocelot was rather good ;)

Ah, that's too bad to hear.

But that is life, I suppose. Oh, well, no hard feelings, at any rate. I wish

Well that's good to hear!

Also, Jakub, you don't mind if we still discuss ideas for Xenocide here? 
Because that was also quite fun (and still is). Even if you aren't actively

Oh, no, I'm not angry with you.  Duty comes before recreation, right? And you

Besides, Xenocide is your project. Even if you abandoned it I wouldn't be 
angry. I might be disappointed, for a bit, but not angry.

I'm still happy to hear that Xenocide is *not* dead, though :D

Besides, I've been playing ADOM for a while now. We ADOM players sometimes 
have to wait years for a new version of ADOM.

Anyway, I wish you luck with life,

God Bless,

Hey

I wish you luck. I have some troubles at university, too. I had to
write missing C program, which took me about 1.5 weeks, several
hours/day. Because I suck at coding and work 4 hours/day. It looks
ugly and segfaults in certain conditions, but saved me. Now I have
lots of *fun* with catching up.

Sadly, I don't have a time machine.
 But how about an ocelot instead ? Get one from here:

They should cheer you up.

Hello guys,

I'm really afraid to say that, but development of Xenocide has to wait
a bit... I'm completely out of time, and will be for the next half
year :(
The development was almost always during weekends, that I have now
taken by university.
I thought that after first semester next one will be less busy...
Well... I was wrong. I have more projects to do, more hours of
lectures and more laboratories :( Moreover, I know the subject of my
thesis for MCS degree:
"Classification of computer viruses with neural networks".
Knowing nothing about neural networks I have to learn a lot.

I can't spent time on Xenocide from Monday to Friday too...
Did I tell you about my promotion? It wasn't as good as I thought.
I became the project manager of the most important piece of our
product: antivirus engine. In next version it's structure must be
completely reorganised, or even rewritten. It wouldn't be so hard if
there was a good documentation and if it wasn't almost directly
converted from assembler to C++ (our AV program is one of the oldest
on the market and was previously written in assembler).
The code is a programmer's hell. I have to clear it up.
After work I'm too tired to do anything with programming :(

But please, remember that Xenocide is NOT dead! Your efforts won't be
useless: Xenocide is my dreamed project and I will finnish it for sure.
I keep it in mind so much, that sometimes I take a piece of paper,
write down ideas, and realise then that hours passed...

I wish to have more free time. Do have a working time machine, I'd
like to buy one...

Hope that you're not angry with me.

best regards,
Jakub

The map looks fine. What bothers me a little is that I don't like
being teleported into unknown area too much. But that's just personal
bias.

There may be a requirement to wait for enemy to attack. Otherwise you
could swap places with panicking monster you chase, that would be a
little silly.

yes, wielkosc = size. How mean, eh ? :-). I guess it would be a good
idea to write some kind of glossary.

unfortunatelly I deleted my most interesting @mail, because I ran into
some space limits on my university account. Perhaps Jakub could send
it to me...

One idea I remember is about levels being platforms one above another.
Without walls, so you could fall down or use jetpack. And you could
see the outline of level below you.

Then there was an idea that firing accuracy is decreased for next turn
if player is hit in melee.

Then something about ceiling-mounted extinguishers which are triggered
by heat. And ones with halon, for a nasty suprise.

I wrote about levels without walls here, right ? There would be just
pits/void instead. I can't remember seeing this in any roguelike. Lava
is not really the same. Same goes for caves. 

> should definitely be turned to "frozen". I can't remember which rule
of English 

according to Jakub it has been corrected weeks ago. I reported it in
one of my @mails.

That's compatible with what I said, I guess. It would require pistols
to be usable to a degree.

> Don't forget the "High-Tech Oil of Rust Removal" :)

Is it a good idea to introduce cursed/blessed item ? Obviously not
literally cursed/blessed. But "blessed" item would be some kind of
weapon someone has been tinkering with (modified). Cursed items would
have hidden defects.
But honestly I think xenocide is fun to play as it is. You can use any
item straight away once you find it, provided you know its purpose.
 

> Energy and Enemy weapons might malfunction, shocking the player or

Exploding doesn't make sense for damaged weapons. It makes sense for
weapons wit 0 hp. But the point of "breaking points" for items is to
allow for repairs.
And athmosphere, you travel corridors in mafunctioning high-tech
armor, searching desperately for some kind of repair tool...

Yes, if you assume you can hit precisely into place the first bullet hit.
if your maintenance skill is high enough.

I'm not sure I actually meant it this way, but it could be done this
way. I thought breaking items would happen mostly from explosions,
hits etc.
It's a bit extreme in System Shock2, because without maintenance skill
weapons seem to simply fall apart. They do this anyway, but with high
maintenance you can repair them to certain point (unless thay have
broken status).

Yes. But it shouldn't happen so often that you could count on it. You
could find other broken items as well, not just bfg.

I have only one idea to share this time:

I want big explosives ! They could be constructed similar to robots:
you choose trigger type and charge type. So you could combine
incendiary charge with time trigger, or toxin charge with motion
sensor, or emp charge with radio trigger.
Explosive charges would be basically very strong grenades, you can't
throw them and they require few turns to set up. You could destroy
most doors and even walls. 
Timed triggers would be easiest to assembly, because they are hard to
use against living targets. Mostly against obstacles.
Motion sensors trigger automatically when something comes close. But
you can have it triggered by a prankster, or run into problems because
 you can't disarm it !
Radio triggers are quite convenient, but basically require you to
monitor the area somehow, and you'd have to spend one turn to detonate
it. The range could be limited, too.
As for charge types I have so many ideas I don't know where to start.
They all should make big bang, in general.
There would be some areas you don't want to explode. Mines,
underground in general - using big explosives can be risky.

Replying to Marek, and Jakub. I'm keeping this one short, guys, so don't 
worry. And, yes, Antti, we're swamping this list with messages so you'll *never* 
have time to respond again ;D

I still think that, if implemented in Xenocide, you should be able to shoot 
at it with some kind of special gun to disperse it. Maybe the "energy 
neutralizer" that drains enemy batteries and cancels forcefields (like a super, 
reusable forcefields disruptor).

Well, I'm glad you think the idea is marginally okay :)

'Cause it took me a bit to draw that @#!% map.

Well, I had assumed that the player would have to be unarmed to take a weapon 
from a foe, so that he would automatically be wielding it himself once done 
with the disarming.

I suppose he could do the same thing while holding a combat knife or other 
small weapon, however. Then the melee weapon would just be transferred into his 
inventory, and he would be holding his enemy's weapon.

Also, yeah, it's kind of hard to grab a sword from someone's hands...

>More less. But should be possible to a degree. You could dodge and run
>past. But yes, it shouldn't work for very big monsters, ones as wide
>as corridor etc.


Oh, well, trying to roll under or past a foe to get into the empty square 
beyond him is a pretty good idea! I hadn't really thought of that. Though I'm 
beginning to think that some of these skills (kicking, rolling, etc.) might be 
performable even with a small weapon in the player's hands (i.e. a light rifle 
and not a bazooka...).

>But size is in ! Every creature has size defined in .dat files.

Oh, is that what "wielkosc" is? I think "waga" is weight, and I was able to 
figure out most everything else in the .dat files using logic. Had no idea what 
"wielkosc" was, though.

>Now I don't remember which ideas I wrote to Jakub only.


It might be good to copy-and-paste them to the list, if only for the purpose 
of archiving them and letting us see them.

>Why bother using crowbar if you can let gas do the work? Um. Yes. Madness.


Of course, madness! "It's a madhouse!" Anyway, the stunning gas grenade won't 
kill the player, so the scientist would have to do it himself.

BTW, I was thinking about the various names applied to status ailments, such 
as "paralysed". To me, "paralysed" conjures the image of one who is completely 
unable to move part of his body, and not merely "slowed" as it is in 
Xenocide. Perhaps "paralysed" could be simply changed to "slowed"? Then, if Jakub 
wants to, he could change "stunned" to "paralysed" (since being stunned has more 
to do with physical trauma and not things like chemical poisons). A new kind of 
"stunning" could then be implemented, which is more a temporary form of 
paralysis in which the player can still try and move, but might not be able to do 
to his status. Also, on the Character Info screen, "blinded" is not the proper 
word form for the word. "Blind" in this case would be better, and "freezed" 
should definitely be turned to "frozen". I can't remember which rule of English 
applies in this case, something about participles and past participles, but I 
know that the rule exists!

So instead of W + S it should be D = W * ([S * .1] + 1 ) with D being the 
total damage, W being the weapon damage, and S being the skill level. This would 
give a 1% increase in damage per skill level in weapons. Of course, this bonus 
can be altered if it becomes really hard to increase weapon skills (I know in 
ADOM it can take forever to get your weapon skills up to 15, something I've 
never done). The bonus should also cap out somewhere, unless the maximum a 
weapon skill can reach is 100 (decimal system makes everything easier), in which 
case the bonus would just top at W * 2.

Well, when I fought him for the first time, I thought he would be really, 
really tough. Like, so though, I would need lots of grenades to kill him with. 
Didn't turn out that way, though.

Yes, I know what you mean. Me, I think there should be a slot for boots 
(combat, radiation proof, insulated, hover), gloves (radiation proof, 
aim-stabilizing, electric iron knuckles), belts (by equipping things to belts, the player 
could easily switch between them at the press of a key, as in '1' switches to 
the first item on the belt... perhaps such a system could replace readying 
weapons? or just allow the player to quickly grab smaller items, like grenades and 
pills... also, belts could let the player hover, and brace his back 
increasing his carrying ability), helmets (as mentioned), and armour. Of course, I 
think it is assumed that the player always has close on under his armour, so that 
I'm wearing slightly more than just a combat vest...

But if different armour pieces are introduced, then I think the BLK status 
for armour should be brought back. No, if the armour is hit it doesn't have to 
become damaged itself (unless weapon in armour piercing), but it can absorb the 
damage instead of the player. For example, there might be a 50% chance the 
enemy will his the enemy, but the combined totals of his armour gives him a 50% 
block rating, meaning that his armour might absorb some of the blow, or that 
the enemy might hit his unprotected skin by passing the armour. Also, if he 
slapped boots and gloves on, then his armour might stand a 70% chance to protect 
him. Larger armour might raise it all the way to 100%. But something like a 
complete hazmat suit, while at 100% blocking, would not provide much protection 
from bullets.

Also, I got to thinking, perhaps there should be a limit to how much, in 
terms of bulk, a player can carry, which can be increased by backpacks and other 
things like that that items can be stored in.

Well, my thought on the matter was that weaker player types, like scientists, 
would rather carry around something like a pistol or a submachine gun, 
instead of lugging around heavy rifles and heaps and heaps of rifle ammo, instead 
saving his inventory for batteries and energy weapons.

Also, yes, pistols are better in close quarters, and since they should be 
weaker, the player would have to decide when to use his pistol, saving his rifle 
ammo for stronger enemies.

Also, in warfare, pistols are usually side arms. No where near as much power 
and range as rifles. They can be much more accurate at close range, however, 
especially in the hands of a weaker character.

Well, I figured they could just be different kinds of tiles, bolted to the 
ground so that they cannot be moved but over which the player can walk. Perhaps 
represented by * signs? Or are those used already?

Maybe not such a good idea after all. Meh.

This makes quite a bit of sense.

Energy and Enemy weapons might malfunction, shocking the player or possibly 
exploding.

The protection rating should probably be decreased.

So guns would slowly wear out as they are used over the course of thousands 
of turns, but if the player knew how to fix them, then they wouldn't? I'm all 
for this idea!

Ah, so sometimes you'll find a *way* powerful, out of depth item, the only 
catch being that it its broken? This makes sense, too. I like it, and it could 
be repaired if the player is very skilled with a constructor tool.

I know this feeling... though I often play dwarves, with good "detect traps

Oh guys, you're killing me! :)
Killing me with these tons of text :)

I'm recently very busy again - work all the time on the very urgent
project for my company. So, the Xenocide has to wait a bit, but I want
to it's source code in my hand so much, that... probably the project
will wait a bit (sorry, I can't focus on many things at the same time
with good results).
Your emails are really inspiring and I'll try to take all the best
from them to make Xenocide really good game.

I'm really sorry, that I do not respond usually, but writing back for
all your mails would take huge amount of time, that I prefer to spend
on programming. Hope you understand.

cheers,
Jakub

Some things just look great in realtime. Sometimes I try to imagine
how stuff would look like in realtime.
 That ball idea is actually Force Of Nature spell in Nox. It looks and
works very mean, spreading many particles as it flies. And it bounces
off walls. And passes thru enemies instead of exploding on them.

Oh, and by the way, when I first entered the bunker I kept looking
around and going cautiously. I suspected something very nasty waiting
for me.
I did so for 2-3 levels until I realised it's simply empty. Not an
ambush, just empty.

I think I prefer to comment it when it's implemented. Then I'll
probably say "too much this" or "too few that" or "some more variety",
etc. I prefer to *test* some ideas in game. But it doesn't sound bad.
Nothing spectacular, either.

It could be possible to use unarmed/melee weapon combo. You fight with
someone (something) holding a sharp item. You disarm him (it) and take
the weapon. 
Of course, disarming opponent who wields a melee weapon should be
fairly difficult.

(swap positions)

More less. But should be possible to a degree. You could dodge and run
past. But yes, it shouldn't work for very big monsters, ones as wide
as corridor etc.

But size is in ! Every creature has size defined in .dat files.
I even suggested that small creatures (with sharp teeth) should be
able to move through windows, remember ? Or was it only in @mail to
Jakub ?
Now I don't remember which ideas I wrote to Jakub only.


(skills)
> Works very well for TOME.

What I propose here is purposedly simplified. From what I remember, in
TOME you can assign skill points to any skill, first tier (swords),
second tier (melee weapons), third tier (combat), and even others. But
in TOME it may be a bit confusing, and harder to balance. My version
would just allow for first tier direct increases, and there would be
just 2 tiers total. And preferably, skills would be increased by use.
So you could even get away without knowing that skill system exists,
actually.
I think it's better to spend time on adding new skills, make sure all
of them are interesting and useful, than on balancing system forever
and adding extra tiers.

 > Anyway, that's how I think skills should generally be implemented.
They're 
> specific, but not TOO specific, and they fall under general categories. 

My point exactly. First tier are specific skills, second tier are just
for "transfering experience" between roughly similar skills. It should
be clear at first glance. Player classes would happen automatically,
because spending a lot of time shooting would make it easier to learn
new weapons, and wouldn't help with chemistry at all.

So there would be, roughly, 3 levels of specialisation:

- skills you're actively using, with high values
- skills that are related to them which receive bonuses, and your
character isn't all that bad in using them
- skills you are not using actively, and are not related to ones you
use. You would be poor at using them.

> Athletics skills might include things like swimming, stealth, and
what not. Haven't

Skills you proposed and categories they fall into don't seem
aggravating to me. They could be implemented that way, I wouldn't object.

Why bother using crowbar if you can let gas do the work? Um. Yes. Madness.

This may be related to what I said about weapon effectiveness earlier.
I think it should be skill*weapon, not skill+weapon like in most
roguelikes. I guess in Xenocide it works second way. There's not so
much difference between using wrench or chainsaw at high skill level
(10 or so).

I suggested all this mainly because I felt there are too few equipable
items. Weapons and armour - 2 item slots. Implants aren't going to be
easy to put off, right ? So they're more like ADOM intrisics (sp?) or
special abilities you acquire once in a while. You know, see
invisible, fire resistance, cursed, teleport control...

Especially when they're filthy, sticky and poisonous.
It bothers me a bit that pistols may be not worth using at all in
later stages of game.
I'd expect the opposite. I'd say rifles may become rare. In modern
warfare, everyone can afford to have a pistol. Pilots, mariners, tank
crew, artillery... They can't really carry big riffles with them, but
you can have a pistol even in fighter cockpit. Or other places where
space is limited...

When I talked to Jakub (@mails) he said that, generally speaking, he
doesn't like idea of "big items" like furniture and rocks, because
they would make display less clear.

> Speaking of ruined armour, shouldn't damaged armour be less
protective? Or is 
> it already?

I have an idea, but didn't say it aloud because Jakub might hate me
for suggesting something so complex.

Many usable items would cease to work when damaged badly (say 20% hp).
 For example gas mask would still protect a bit against criticals, but
holes in it make it useless as a gas protection device.

Ranged weapons would no longer fire, but could be used as clubs.

Mining helmet would still protect from criticals, but the lamp would
no longer work.

In general, some functions of items would require that items are in
good shape. The % hp required could even vary from item to item, for
example rubber+glass gas mask would have pretty low damage tolerance,
high-tech fancy weapons/equipment a bit better, sturdy old-school
ballistic weapons would be moderately resistant to damage (would
require sigificant damage to stop working).

This way repair skill would be quite useful. Think of it as
"recharging normal equipment", you could simply repair it instead of
throwing away.
Just like in System Shock2, except in that game you can totally avoid
breaking your weapons if your maintenance skill is high enough.
Also like in System Shock2, you could often find some interesting
weapons, which are broken. There's a broken laser pistol in
Engineering deck, and for fully functional one you have to travel farther.
In general, new weapons appear as broken at first. You can use
repaired weapons before you find fully working ones.
I think it would be great in Xenocide.

It would be less annoying for me if ADOM traps were dealing more
damage and not destroying items. You can avoid many traps by kicking
the door diagonally. 
I ended up putting away most valuables before kicking doors. Even
being suprised by angry crowd is more pleasant than losing your very
needed items.

Well, hellooooooooooooooooo all! It's taken me a while to write this titanic 
tome of a response, and it's finally finished! A reply to everyone, in four 
behemoth acts, written so sloppily that the rules of grammar cease to apply.

Be forewarned, I have been am in a jocular mood over the past few days, 
writing this response.

Now, onto the show...

ATTO I: REPLY TO ANTTI

>as there won't be any areas of vacuum in Xenocide... will there?)

Speaking of vacuum, I noticed that the outer walls on the space ship are 
indestructible. I tried messing with their values in the data folder, only to find 
that when I destroy one such wall, the game crashes. Wouldn't it be better to 
make such walls really strong, but still breakable. That way stupid, 
determined players can keep attacking them and, with enough persistence, break a hole 
in them, at which point they would be sucked out of the ship and into the 
vacuum and die...

Just a pleasant little hidden extra...

>(though I disagree with making energy
>weapons so powerful... grenades and rockets should, IMO, inspire awe even
>after beam weapons are introduced... and not just because of their area
>effect)

Well, of course the immense heat and expanding gases will always be extremely 
powerful. This is tempered by the fact, however, that while rockets can take 
out large numbers of foes at once, they cannot be used in close quarters, and 
they might just damage the surrounding terrain in ways not favourable to the 
player, not to admit revealing his position to his enemies.



The radiation surge would perhaps be best handled as a special
effect that stuns robots on a hit (duration could simply be based on armour
value, on the assumption that military robots, the best-armoured kind, would
also have hardened internal circuitry). Carried models would probably only
be capable of single shots.

Not a lot of radiation...

Darn. I was hoping said particle guns would be the weapons I could use to 
"irradiate" (good word choice, Antti) enemies from across long distances. Well, 
we'll still need something like that, aside from "dirty bomb" grenades...

Well, the character information screen could be divided into pages, ala 
Angband, for the sake of simplicity. That way no additional key is required to 
access it.

Well, I just figured that there would be plenty of room for one or two extra 
slots in the body, so long as the implant's parts are spread 'thin' throughout 
it.

Well, I was kinda thinking about this, and I thought that modifying the 
battery system a bit might be beneficial. Namely, my idea was to make all of the 
energy items found earlier in the game a good deal weaker, and to expand the 
batteries' power supplies, so that while they might have a hundred units of power 
or so in them (the smallest ones), they would not recharge. This way, the 
player could use energy items for longer amounts of time, but once his batteries 
are dead, they don't regain energy on their own. Some what more realistic, I 
guess. Anyway, after his power is gone, the player would either need to find 
new batteries (the hard way) or find some other means of recharging them, namely 
"powercells" (snatching up dropped word and giving it new, better meaning...) 
and recharging stations. Powercells would be tiny devices used to recharge 
batteries (and possibly other devices), with practical applications for miners 
so they can just use them to recharge their batteries instead of worrying about 
finding new ones. The powercells would contain less than an actual battery, 
maybe a fourth as much. So if the machine battery had 100 units of power, the 
mini powercell would give a boost of 25. If the mining battery had 200 hundred, 
then the small powercell would give 50. Eventually, with more powerful energy 
devices that drain more energy per use, recharging batteries would be 
introduced. Also, Antti, I like the idea of a generator that regenerates faster but 
doesn't increase total power capacity.

On the matter of recharging stations, these would be special interactive 
tiles ala the Genetic Machine that bring the player to an interface screen. The 
player, from this screen, can used it to recharge his batteries up to a certain 
amount (i.e. certain stations might only give 300 points of energy back per 
recharge, others less, others more). The one drawback to using this is that the 
recharging station must itself be recharged after use before the player can 
use it again. Therefore, he cannot keep using the station continuously to give 
him an unlimited supply of power. Such stations would be found randomly in 
places like the mines and the bunker, set pretty far apart, but occasionally found 
in tiny clusters guarded by tough enemies, sort of like vaults. These would 
of course be rarities, because they are so useful, so that if the player really 
*has* to use one he might have to go and trek back over several levels to get 
there.

Anyway, that's just my overly verbose idea.

Onto the next segment.

blowtorch.

I could not decide whether this would be best to be 'fired' ala a pistol with 
a very short range, or merely used as an energy weapon, ala the chainsaw. 
That would probably be best. And it could stand the chance of igniting enemies...

>> SPREADER CANNON

Well, if Jakub makes shotguns have the spread fire that I suggested, it could 
easily be used on this gun. The idea was, yes, a burst of plasma 'particles' 
that spread outward. Plasma shotgun, really...

>that

Still like Marek's idea about the gun that shoots the large, slow moving 
energy ball. Bwa ha ha ha ha!!!

Well, the five shot idea was meant so that all of the shots could hit the 
danged target at long range.

Also, I'm not too fond of the random burst fire thing. I don't know, it just 
seems odd. Doesn't stop me from using it, albeit only at close range.

Yes, well, there aren't many mounted infantrymen running around the west 
these days (or even the far east for that matter) so it's kind of an excusable 
mistake.

Yes, we know, no explosive powder charge packed into them, the ammo would be 
lighter. I was talking about the weight of the guns themselves, though, ammo 
not withstanding. Though that might not be right either, seeing as these 
railguns won't have batteries built into them.

Well, the sabot was supposed to be magnetic, ala iron, while the projectile 
would not be ferromagnetic, or at least would not *have* to be ferromagnetic. 
So things like futuristic, super-penetrating crystal slugs that shred through 
enemy armour and then break apart inside them like glass could be launched from 
them.

Well, I imagined it would have one very weak clawing attack, just for the 
sake of completeness. I do like the idea of some non-hostile, if not totally 
friendly, enemies.

In fact, I had an idea for a fun little monster in the caves, a unique called 
the "Quonk", a large, elephantine, round monster that, while neutral to the 
player, roams about swallowing small enemies whole. It is slow to move, because 
it is so fat, but this fat is also super-endurable, making it nearly 
impervious to damage. As said before, not interested in eating the player, preferring 
to prey on enemies and devour items, as well as the occasional wall, but if 
the player accidentally harms it, then it will become mad at him, and start 
moving faster than usual. While it can't swallow him whole, it's teeth can take 
large chunks of damage away, and it can eat his armour right off of him. Also, 
its deadly howl attack can paralyse the player with fear. Nearly impossible to 
kill, and once it hates the player, it will always be hostile, so that the 
level this beast is found on will become very, very dangerous.

If you're wondering what this thing is supposed, it is a giant, overweight 
beagle. I've had personal experience with such dogs in the past, one in 
particular who I dubbed "Quonk" because of the pig like noises it always makes. These 
are stubborn, evil animals, who are always sniffing the ground in the hopes of 
finding some kind of food or a small animal to devour. And their baying is 
hideous as well, if you have never heard it. I, personally, think it would make 
a great unique, though it's never actually *stated* to be a malformed alien 
mutt.

Anyway...

No, no, no, the player would have good reason to go near the shrubs. He could 
possibly pick them, and use them to heal himself, ala the proposed chemical 
system, perhaps? Also, it would be possible to make it so regions with shrubs 
might provide the player with something to ward off heat stroke, water or 
something like that? (Assuming the player can start to take damage from wandering 
in the desert for too long, first the message "the sun beams menacingly down on 
you from above" followed by "the desert heat is starting to get to you" to 
"the desert begins to take its toll", at which point the player would gradually 
have his strength and what not lowered, as well as his life points. This would 
be easily remedied by finding an oasis and entering into the shallow pool of 
water. This system would prevent players from crossing from desert screen to 
desert screen without doing anything... though perhaps later in the game he 
could find an item that would reduce the need for this... the +2 +4 Wide Brimmed 
Hat of Shade? :)

Well, I've been thinking about this, and while the random element doesn't 
bother me, the fact that this idea is starting to sound really hokey does. Seeing 
as how radiation usually gives people the sort of terminally ill mutations, 
rather than the see-through-walls mutation, this might be too implausible for 
this game. I mean, with the animals in the wild, it's *kind* of plausible, but 
not with the player being hit with gamma rays and then suddenly being able to 
fly. We should just stick to the more realistic stuff, like warp gates, aliens 
and the player not needing to eat ;)

Well, I assumed that's what Jakub meant. You know, like a naturally occurring 
plutonium rock-garden...

Now that you mention it, it should read "in ways", because lacking the "in"

Lousy past tense. You might as well point out that it is technically wrong to

Because, "esque" sounds cooler. Just check out the following (a smallish

Well thank you. Also, thanks for pointing out the typos. I'll try and fix 
those later, along with all the other monster descriptions. You know, the stained 
worm descriptions still has the phrase "stainy worm" stuck in there...

I used to think the same way, but... I think I just saw this method being 
utilized well enough to inform the player of the impending doom. If you want me 
to change it, however, I can.

Speaking of the Doc, um, how to say this...

I once said...

And Jakub said in reply...

So, anyway, what happened to the whole 4 tile thing? Has the plan for 
multi-tile monsters been scraped? Or just postponed?

Just wondering...

Ok, I get it now. Now, I like this. How about, when you exit a map, you get 
the message "You wander [north, east, south, west] across the unchanging dunes 
for some time, until you come to a place of interest..."

This would then generate the player an altogether new map in the desert, with 
him at the edge.

Also, the aforementioned heatstroke system would prevent him from just 
walking back and forth between levels, because the time he spends walking about 
takes its toll on him. Of course, every area in the desert should have some small 
oasis near its centre, perhaps encased by rocks, titanic alien bones, and 
various cacti, all of which could act as walls of sorts (mostly the rocks, of 
course, perhaps forming great canyons and what not).

Also, on the matter of terrain, what about a slow acting quicksand (not 
usually found in deserts, but it is an alien world, in a game) that can slow the 
player down, and drown him if he remains in it for too long, and great 
radioactive rocks that will harm the player if he passes by them?

So the further you go in one direction, the more likely you are to come 
across a specific entrance to an area, while the less likely you are to come across 
other areas? I like this idea, I like it quite a bit.

It also makes sense that it could take 1 or 10 levels to find a place, taking 
my suggested "you wander" message into account.

I'm glad to see you liked my idea so much :D

It might be a good idea to toss in an idea I saw mentioned on r.g.r.d a while 
back, which I am adopting for the temple, namely...

You hear an odd click...

#########
#.......#
....@....
#.......#
#########

Suddenly the exits leading out of the room are sealed shut...

#########
#.......#
#...@...#
#.......#
#########

The walls begin to close in...

#########
#.....#
#..@..#
#.....#

"This is part of the story, right?..."

#########

#.@.#
#...#
#########

"Aw, man!"

#########
#.#
#@#
#.#
#########

You have died...

#########
#
#
#
#########

Of course, it would take several turns for the walls to move even one space. 
Also, there would always be some sort of weak wall / secret door that the 
player could easily use to escape. The whole point of this would be to keep him 
moving forward.

Maybe something like this would be better...

The @ is the player, the # in the middle of the corridor is a large crushing 
part of the ceiling or the wall that occasionally falls down to smash the 
player. The / is the same thing, only one that is currently open, allowing the 
player to pass through it. The #s act like walls, but if the player is standing 
on a / when it changes into a # (they switch at regular intervals) he gets 
pounded for quite a bit of damage. This can be dangerous when fighting enemies, 
but if you can trap them by a crusher...

This idea might actually go better in the factory, with big metal cylinders 
falling down from above to crush the player.

Yes, I have noticed this, too. Have you noticed that the walls on the ship 
are bilaterally symmetrical? Now that's what I call innovation. The same goes 
for the mines, combing natural and manmade passages with cool smoke, and the lab 
(which is really a tactics zone, using the plastic doors to your advantage, 
though I think it might be a bit too easy right now...).

This variation in level designs is really a breath of fresh air compared to 
ADOM and Crawl. Both fine games, but the dungeon-cave thing can get a little 
old after a while, and very old after a while longer.

On the matter of the bunker, what if there was an occasional room that has 
very heavily fortified, with a nigh-unbreakable locked door on one side of the 
base, and a very tough Enemy Commando in a mecha-suit with the key somewhere 
else in the level. Such rooms could contain special vaults filled with enemies, 
weapons / ammo, recharging / healing stations, computer terminals (that might 
allow the player to shut off / reprogram security robots on the same level as 
him) or other little things like that. Maybe even the lift leading to the next 
level is inside of a locked door occasionally?

Well, not too wide. Though the levels in Xenocide are quite big, and the 
bunker seems huge, way bigger than the city.

Well, the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that any such city 
should not seem as well ordered and majestic as the temples. It should seem 
dead, forgotten, a ghostly relic of an age long since past, wrought of crumbling 
pillars and buildings razed by the grinding wheel of time, not inhabited by 
ancient creations, but by a myriad of crawling quantum critters (as well as the 
more advanced Enemy troops with their heavily-fortified research bases).

The buildings in the city as I envisioned it would be mostly round, 
inter-connected structures with strange winding passageways, as well as outside areas 
that give the player more mobility but less cover. Of course, there would be 
the Enemy bases as well.

Then I got to thinking, what if the rooms in the city were not connected by 
long corridors, but rather were interlocking chambers with unbreakable walls 
connected by teleportation devices. For example...

###############################################

The < in this mini-level is the teleportation pad leading to the previous 
level, while the > leads to the next level. The numbers are connected telepads, 1 
teleports to 1, and vice versa (though they would not be numbered in the 
game, probably instead appearing as specially coloured, flashing <s that the 
player can enter, the player would have to remember which ones lead where). As you 
can see, it is possible to have multiple routes leading through the city 
levels, each filled with its own pitfalls (different enemies, as well as Enemies, 
and what not) and benefits (items, other usable devices).

Also, the Xs in the above map represent the walls of the enemy base, 
displayed as a separate symbol so you can tell them apart. Obviously, these little 
rooms would be stocked with enemy troops and scientists, and would also probably 
contain valuable items.

Of course, the rooms would be bigger in the real game, and more intricate, 
though not *too* big. There could be anywhere between ten and twenty on one 
given level. I don't know, honestly, how many such rooms could fit on one screen. 
And I really don't know how you'd right and algorithm to generate such 
levels...

Also,  it would be possible to have old hulks of ancient machinery lying 
around, ones that can be activated like the genetic machine. They could be healing 
devices, mapping stations (ala DooM RL), chaos devices (ala the pools in 
ADOM), alarm triggers that summon enemies (a nasty trick), random warping devices, 
random item generators, battery rechargers, and even "mind-links" that give 
the player and XP boost. Some of the better machines would, of course, be 
guarded by the Enemy.

As for non-Enemy enemies in this level, they would probably be strange, 
extradimensional life forms that have escaped into the city via the warp gate, 
being drawn to its strange energy field (which could also cause batteries to 
regenerate slightly faster, and / or disrupt the use of certain electronic 
devices). There could also be advanced ancient guardians, though I am shying away from 
this idea. What do you guys think?

"You push the T-2000 into the molten metal pit!"

I like this idea...

Though adding kicking could accomplish as much at close range.

Oh, and what about an alien weapon that uses energy to create solid bullets? 
That way wimpy scientists who can't carry around loads and loads of ammo will 
be able to kill things like the Angelesque.

This would be better, IMHO, for a flashlight, which the player could use to 
target a certain area, which would always be illuminated until he changed the 
light's target. The lamp, IMHO once more, should have a wider radius of effect.

>Speaking of the searchlights, I'm not entirely sure how this works right now,

Now this is a good idea. It could even be semi-prescripted, so that when the 
player comes onto the level, he immediately sees a miner getting mowed down.

Well, the idea was that the player could directly control the drones from 
afar. Although... what if the player could attach a device to any bot that would 
let him remote-control it over a certain distance?

I don't know what HE stands for in real life. Maybe the HE, in Xenocide, can 
stand for "Hell on Earth"? And it is like the sequel to the standard grenade. 
You might call it "GrenadE II: Hell on Earth".

Yes, well with large clusters, it can be assumed that something like a 80% 
hit rate will ensure most of the fragments hit a target, while some others still 
escape.

Well, I don't know about you, but if I walked into a building and found 
bloody, dismembered corpses strewn everywhere, I would be pretty creeped out.

That feeling, however, would be more akin to primal terror. Real horror, I 
suppose, is the kind that worms its way into your mind and starts messing things 
around. Little atmospheric touches like the smoke in the mines, or the player 
hearing (or not hearing, in this case) a strange sound to announce an odd 
occurrence, can really make a difference.

Hey, everyone, if you haven't read Kornel Kisielewicz's essay "Horror in a 
Roguelike", I suggest you search it out and read it now. It was on UseNet, so it 
should be archived on Google.

And yes, he is the same man behind DooM RL and the (supposedly) upcoming 
Genrogue.

Using the 'A' command could easily bring up a small window listing available 
attack options.

And, IMHO, fighting unarmed should be much weaker than fighting with weapons. 
In fact, aside from disarming / switching places with / doing other things to 
opponents, it should be downright useless (a skill for it still is good, 
because players will always want to be able to have something to fall back on in 
case they lose all of their weapons). Unarmed combat should, methinks, be very 
tactical, and not very forceful.


>Then there's the more general question... Is there really any reason to
>include an "Unarmed Fighting" skill in the first place, other than for that
>one player who'll eventually try it?

Well, the more the player tries to disarm and opponent, the better he should 
get at it. The same for when the player is out of ammo, and something has 
happened to all of his weapons. Then all he is left with is his fists and, if he's 
lucky, his feet. So, yes, a skill should still be in the game, even if it is 
not often used. It can always be easier to advance in, but have a lower 
potential than the rest.

>Some of these "special moves" might include:

Well, the target could have a ranged weapon, but he might just counter and 
fire while he's going back. Also, this should only stand a good *chance to knock 
an enemy back*, based on the player's strength relative to the monster's 
stats and weight, and might also knock him down in the target is not too big on 
dexterity, stunning him for one turn.

BTW, this could be done with a weapon in the player's hands...

>- Throw/Flip: moves the target to the exact opposite side of the player (note
>that this essentially works the same as Marek's "exchange places" move). Has 
a
>50% chance to Stun the target. Requirements: dexterity more than target
>weight/10,000

A good idea, but the size of the monster should also be factored in. "You 
switch places with the t-rex" shouldn't really be possible...

I did suggest a scale system at one time, where every monster is given a 
"size number" that is factored into certain equations and what not...

>- Sweep: Stuns the target (or knocks it to the ground, if stances are ever
>implemented). Requirements: strength more than target dexterity, target must
>be capable of motion (which implies an upright posture)


"You trip the target. It falls to the ground!" could be a message meaning 
simply that it is stunned for one or two turns, and when it moves again the 
message "The % gets up off the ground" could be displayed. Of course, certain 
enemies, such as giant centipedes, could not be tripped, for obvious reasons.

I don't know...

Wait, how about a "low kick" that the player can use on male human opponents 
to stun them and cause a good deal of damage. Not very honourable, but still...

>The pen-and-paper method and the switch-to-Notepad method of taking notes are

I usually save such notes in the same directory as the game. Such an in-game 
system would be very helpful, however, and I'm all for it, so long as Jakub 
doesn't have to postpone other game features, such as skills, to do it.

A simple %2 damage bonus and plus 0.5% to critical hit rate per successful 
autopsy would be good, with the player gaining random information about them as 
he did this. The damage bonus rating per creature would probably top out 
around 50%, while the critical hit rating would top out around 10%. So, yes, quite 
a few autopsies would have to be done to get the full effect (around 25 for 
the damage bonus, and twenty times for the critical hit bonus). The random 
information mentioned would probably amount to resistances and average stats, which 
could be available through a monster memory system (ala the '&' sign in 
ADOM). This would also be beneficial with random resistances (if implemented, 
though I think that if we're going to add random resistances, we might as well make 
semi-random enemies, which probably wouldn't be as hard as it sounds.)

Well, I think the whole matter of fire rates could be simplified if a global 
time system was implemented, but Jakub has said he won't be implementing such 
a system :(

I personally don't think it would be all that hard to implement, if a system 
kind of like the one in ADOM is used. Namely, time in the game does not 
progress solely in turns, but rather on a clock, probably being calculated down to a 
hundredth of a second. Now, every action in the game has an "energy" value 
assigned to it, or how much effort has to be spent to perform a certain action.

Let us say that the player is walking, and that walking one square uses up 
1000 points of effort. The player would first have to exert this effort before 
he could move. How quickly he does this is determined by his speed score. The 
player, based on his speed score, would exert so much energy with every passing 
of the smallest unit of time in the game, specifically, in this example, a 
hundredth of a second. Based on his speed score, the game takes into account how 
much effort he can exert per 1/100th of a second, and then calculates how 
many 1/100ths of a second it would take him to perform such an action. This would 
not take long, and could be done with a quite simple equation.

How long does walking take?

First check how many effort points are required, in this case 1000.

E = 1000

The speed of walking is judged by the player's speed score. So we get that, 
too, in this case 25.

S = 25

Now, every one point of speed will allow the player to use a certain amount 
of effort per turn. Let us say that amount is 0.4.

P = 0.4

T stands for the final amount of 1/100ths of a second that it will take for 
the player to perform said actions.

So the equation would probably go like this. To figure out how long it takes 
the player to walk one square:

T = E / (S * P)

In this case, T = 100, so it will take the player exactly one second to walk 
across one square. This number is then added to the global clock, and posted 
on a hidden "checklist". Let us say the global clock reads 08:00:00:00.

The action of the player walking would be added to the list, with the time of 
start and completion, the completion being 08:00:01:00. It might look like 
this:

PLAYER WALK - 08:00:00:00 to 08:00:01:00

This list is important, and what makes the time feature work. This allows 
multiple events to happen in order, based on time.

For example, let us say the time is 08:00:00:00. The player is fighting a 
claw rat. The claw rat claws at him, while at the same time the player fires his 
rifle on three round burst. All of these actions would be quickly calculated 
and added to the checklist, like so:

PLAYER FIRE WEAPON - 08:00:00:00 to 08:00:00:30
RIFLE FIRE BULLET  - 08:00:00:00 to 08:00:00:40
RIFLE FIRE BULLET  - 08:00:00:40 to 08:00:00:50
CLAW RAT ATTACKS   - 08:00:00:00 to 08:00:00:70
RIFLE FIRE BULLET  - 08:00:00:50 to 08:00:01:00
PLAYER READJUST    - 08:00:01:00 to 08:00:01:10

The actual act of aiming and firing the rifle takes the player 30/100 of a 
second. Doing this signals the rifle to fire off three bullets in succession. It 
takes each bullet 10/100 of a second to fire (way too slow, I think, but it's 
just an example). Each bullet is set to fire 10/100 of a second after the 
first. Notice that in this example, the claw rat is set to attack before the last 
bullet is fired. While this is not really possible with the current time 
system, it would be quite simple with this time system. Also, the PLAYER READJUST 
refers to how long the player takes to readjust him aim and what not following 
firing.

The time counter then rushes forward to the next action on the list. Monsters 
can perform new actions as soon as all of their old actions have been 
completed, and disappeared from the list. The player only gets a turn when all of his 
personal actions have ended (so, once PLAYER READJUST was completed, the 
player could do something again).

If you're wondering why the beginning time is listed, also, this is so that 
certain actions can be "interrupted", meaning that the player shooting the claw 
rat while it has already decided to claw him might keep it from attacking. If 
the claw rat starts to attack after the first two bullets hit him, however, 
then they could do nothing to stop him. That third one might, though. This is 
assuming that shooting enemies might cause them to abort their current course 
of action, like reloading a pistol or trying to run away or what not.

This might seem like a bit to implement now, but I believe this system will 
make it easier to implement things in the future. Say, for example, that the 
player gets a leg implant that makes his walking faster, but nothing else. All 
you would have to do was either decrease the E (effort) value in the above 
equation, or increase the P (effort points per 1/100 of a second) value for the 
equation tied to walking. This can be quite simply done, I believe.

Also, using this system, a slowed player's gun would still fire just as fast, 
though he would take longer to aim and pull the trigger. Of course, all guns 
would have fixed fire rate, the RIFLE FIRE BULLET action not being dependent 
on any of the player's stats (though perhaps a modification could speed up the 
fire rate).

Now, applying this system to full automatic fire: in full automatic, the 
player would simply fire one shot per "turn", but a turn would take much less time 
after the first shot (using the time checklist method), because the PLAYER 
FIRE WEAPON does not need to be done, so long as the player is still firing at 
the same target. As long as the player fires turn after turn and does nothing 
else, his shots will fly out of his gun faster than if he was on 
semi-automatic. This, however, poses the danger of players getting carried away with their 
full auto fire and wasting all of their ammo. If the player does anything other 
than fires, Xenocide assumes he has stopped, and runs the PLAYER READJUST, 
followed by his current action.

This is, of course, a very brief sketch of such a proposed idea. I know you 
said you didn't want to implement it, Jakub, but I figured I would post it here 
anyway, just to see what everyone thought. I thought maybe if I explained my 
idea more in depth that you might feel more partial to it. I won't be 
bothersome about it, though, if you still decided not too...

Yes, typing '5' while on fire should display the message "you drop to the 
ground and roll about, trying to extinguish your flames". Of course, once the 
fire is out, you would still take a bit to get back up.

Yes, I like this idea. The player should run about frantically, thinking not 
of defence and only be able to attack enemies by randomly bumping into them 
and bludgeon them with his flaming fists (perhaps catching them on fire, too). 
Of course, most player would figure out stop-drop-and-roll sooner or later, but 
there might be times when running is better than throwing oneself down onto 
the ground. Like when you'd be throwing yourself down on the ground in front of 
a giant fire-breathing lizard.

Yes, this makes good sense. Most "sealed" armour, IMHO, should require the 
addition of a helmet to reap the full effects of being sealed in (e.g. hazmat 
suits, space suits).

Well, I like long lists of skills... so long as it is made clear which ones 
are vital, and which ones are merely helpful. Like in ADOM, healing is a pretty 
important skill to all situations, while bridge building is only useful if 
you need to build bridges.

So yes, I like long skill lists, but I think it is important to make it clear 
that putting all of your training into learning how to mix chemicals won't be 
of much help if you can't fight off the guys trying to kill you.

On the matter of skills, I've been thinking about how I would like to see the 
new skill system implemented. Aside from weapon skills (I haven't thought as 
much about those), this is a partial list of how I think things should go...

PRACTICAL SKILLS (dependent mostly on dexterity, and some intelligence)

CONSTRUCTION > Affects how successful players will be when trying to mend 
armour. Also, if the player is trying to build new items (as in using a 
nanoforming tool to make armour out of a mineral he found) this would affect whether or 
not he is successful.

ROBOTICS > This affects how well mechanics can assemble robots, and how well 
they can work with them. Perhaps exactly like the current "mechanics" skill.

ELECTRONICS > This is how skilled the player is at working with wiring and 
circuitry, as well as using electronic devices in general. Not only vital to

Anyway, that's how I think skills should generally be implemented. They're 
specific, but not TOO specific, and they fall under general categories. 
Athletics skills might include things like swimming, stealth, and what not. Haven't 
though much about those, sadly. So, what do you guys think? (You probably think

Well, I thought that alien / strange weapons should function more like magic

because of the fact that most of them don't have normal triggers, but an 
assortment of buttons and switches. So, yes, it's magic. So shoot me :)

You do know that there can be multiple schools of fighting revolving around 
one kind of weapon. Using this logic, kendo and sabre-fencing should be 
identically similar.

For the purpose of this game, however, I think this can work.

Well, this system could work, so long as it becomes possible to target an 
enemy without first firing. It only makes sense that you would have to target an 
enemy before aiming at them. Then, after your foe is targeted, and you tap 
'5', the message "You take aim at the %" could de displayed.

I thought aiming once would be good. Though I had wondered if attaching a

Yes, we know. Pounds Per Square Whatever.

I've been wondering, though, if the AP flag should go, and instead be 
replaced by a concentration stat that would effect how likely an item is to punch 
through armour. I.e. a regular bullet is more likely to punch through something 
than a wooden rail, while a knife is more likely to punch through something 
than a normal bullet...

Also, armour could have a "Resist AP" stat, so that some armour, like armours 
in real life, could have hard plates that protect against puncturing.

Anyway, the thing about shields was intended to be a game play thing, nothing 
more, nothing less.

Well, I've seen this in games like ADOM, where you're just "sick" and I

Well, perhaps not crouching (though I think there should still be tiny ducts

tactics? You know, aggressive, normal, defensive? King of like in DooM RL, or in 
ADOM (in ADOM it is real easy to switch between tactics at the push of a key, 
F4 switches to normal, F3 to aggressive, F5 to defensive, F2 to very 
aggressive, etc.).

hitting 'y', the ten-second count-down occurs, at the end of which the player is

I second this thought! True, there are not many useful items and tools yet, 
but it could not hurt miners to have more odd weapons and whatnot. You know, a 
few extra bullets, a suit of actually good armour, a gun or a pill or a 
grenade. The same is true of levels in general. There should probably be more junk 
lying around the genetic lab, bullets and what not, even if they are not 
dropped by enemies.

Also, why can't we sometimes see a crazy scientist clad in a hazmat suit, 
that protects him from gas and other environmental factors, that tries and gas 
the player to death by tossing gas grenades about willy-nilly. That way he can 
run right through the gas, and bludgeon the player to death with a crowbar.

Since you've mentioned this, I've tried using the wrench more (also my 
preferred melee weapon), to find it is way too powerful. It makes sense to me to try 
and conserve your ammo by bashing weak enemies to death with blunt objects, 
and save your ammo for tougher foes. This system doesn't really work, however, 
seeing as that ranged weapons aren't all that great...

I would suggest that normal, non-powered melee weapons be made very weak, in 
contrast to bullets. The same with nails from the nail gun. The only time it 
should be feasible to use wrenches and knives in combat is when faced with weak 
enemies, or when you turn a corner and find a miner trying to chop you do 
death with an axe.

Pistols should be pretty powerful, but the real standard weapon in the game 
should be rifles and shotguns. The more I play Xenocide, the more I start to 
wonder if it is perhaps too easy, in that it is so simple to kill foes. By 
making rifles the most effective weapon in the game, and by making rifle ammo more 
common, the enemies can also be made harder to kill. Also, many enemies might 
be able to do more damage to the player. This can be balanced out by putting 
more armour in the game.

Herr Doktor, BTW, truly is pushover. Methinks he should be much more 
devastating in melee than he currently is, and that he should fire more needles, 
shooting out a cloud of them as opposed to a single, powerful needle. Also, the 
globs of goo he fires (perhaps it should be webbing since he is part spider) 
should not only slow down the player, but if they miss they will land on the 
ground and become sort of "sticky traps" which affect the player even if he walks 
over them.

On the matter of powered melee weapons, I think that the chainsaw should be 
comparable in power to a weak rifle, and that the drill should be the same but 
armour piercing. This would work out quite well if you decide to implement my 
proposed new energy system, Jakub, because even though the player will not 
want to risk getting close to powerful enemies to hit them with the chainsaw, he 
would realise that he can use the chainsaw more before running out of power, 
and conserve his rifle ammo.

Power-melee weapons later in the game, IMHO, should be stronger than most 
ranged weapons. I have a good explanation for this, too, namely that scientists 
have figured out how to put short-range gravity-generators in futuristic 
weapons to increase the force applied by the weapon exponentially, without effect 
the weapon itself. The only problem is that such generators cannot be used 
efficiently in bullets, and so can only be used in melee weapons. Often these 
weapons will be used in war zones by men outfitted in heavy armour and toting big 
shields. These soldiers slowly advanced toward things protected by powerful 
force-fields and proceed to bash at them until the pop. Also, their 
super-melee-weapons are often used to take out other heavily armoured units, such as 
themselves, who have armour so advanced that it makes them difficult to kill even 
with rockets. Oh, these guys can be an enemy. They can be called the Phalanx! 
The "Crazy Phalanx", to be precise.

Marek.

A stronger version of this should be the hazmat helmet...

Once again, I think several kinds of special helmets should be incorporated.

BTW, could a player wear a helmet and night-vision goggles? I know he 
couldn't wear a mask and goggles... Unless all goggles were built into helmets. Or 
perhaps there are multiple head-slots? Skull, ears, eyes, nose, mouth? Probably 
too complex...

Unarmed combat, things like swapping, tackling, tripping and disarming, would 
probably be best utilized by a stealthful player (except for swapping). I can 
imagine putting on an invisibility suit and snatching the gun out of the 
hands of my foe before he even sees me, then using said gun to kill him before he 
had react. Bwa ha ha ha haaaaa!

It might be possible to create semi-randomly generated enemies, and not just 
the sort that crawl out of bowls of oatmeal that are left in the sun for too 
long. I'll try and think up a system for this, unless someone else beats me to 
it.

>See ? ;]
>Melee weapons are more foolproof, in general.


I think the greatest benefit to using melee weapons should be their lack of 
needing ammo (or, for power ones, their more extensive ammo / greater attacking 
strength), their over all accuracy (easier to chainsaw someone to death up 
close than shoot him from afar), and the defensive bonus they give in melee 
combat.

I would probably fall to the ground very, very fast, and being rolling about

Well, I like the idea of having shields, because (a) it gives the player 
something to use as portable cover from enemy fire, and (b) it adds another 
dimension of character customisation to the game, without seeming all that corny.

I think you're right about the lack of psionics. Enemies with these powers, 
or items that give you one or two psychic abilities, I think are good. But the 
player shouldn't really be able to shoot fire balls from his forehead or 
anything like that.

>Hole left after "removing" magic should somehow be filled.

My suggestion is to have lots of odd items, especially Enemy guns, which I 
had imagined to be more tactical and "magical" in nature (look over the energy 
weapon suggestions I sent in once more). I would imagine that there are plenty 
of ways to calm monsters, teleport, heal fast, etc. using reusable items 
(devices that drain power).

Now I really like this idea. Crouching down would be automatic, obviously. I 
think that the player should be able to escape into these passages to evade 
enemies that are too large to follow him. Encountering smaller enemies in the 
crawlspaces, however, would leave him at a disadvantage.

2. Desert Wind (or wind in general, in open)

Great idea! This would be at its most effective in wide open spaces of the 
desert where there are no rock walls to shield you. Bullets should definitely 
drift, especially is wind is so strong as to slow the player down. I think that 
the wind should rise up, and then die down before shifting, and then rise up 
again. Also, if my proposed time system is implemented, it would not be hard to 
make walking into the wind slower by simply increasing the energy required by 
performing this action.

>3. New grenades (improvised?)

What about a proximity grenade that lies still, so enemies think they are 
safe so long as they stay away from it, but then it starts to roll really fast 
toward them, before exploding right under them.

>- pressured paint grenade

Another great idea. Can make invisible enemies visible, and can also mark 
enemies that are hiding amongst an ocean of holograms of themselves.

Yes, it should. The gas is a cool effect, but it doesn't seem to spread quite 
right.

It should probably spread out more, starting out small, then spreading really 
fast, then slowing down. Gas will spread and spread until it has filled its 
contained, but I guess you know that already.

Also, more powerful versions of existing gas grenades could have wider 
radiuses.

It should not be based on the enemy dropping it, methinks, but based on the

This is the ultimate pain in this game. Thankfully, however, we do not have

I think  you'll like it. It's not so much about combat, because you
can be stealthy and avoid many fights... but not in Hive. Still there
are nice firearms for you to assembly. Combat isn't all that fast, so
realtime is not really a downside. You can run away, too. It's best
described as survival game.
And flamer is very very mean, even taking very short range into
account. Burns organic bosses in seconds.

I know. And - obviously - bunker is empty now. But Xenocide should
avoid getting too predictable. I vote for small chance of dropping
random item, like 5% or so. Items would have to be divided into
levels, at least roughly for this to work. So you won't get BFG 32768
from first enemy.

Looks just like that in game. And has very nasty effect, disease kills
several % of population in province where he's at the moment. One of 4
top shelf demons.

Now that you mention it, I remember I heard about it somewhere.

How about Shedu ?

No, I mean cutting heads and sending them back. Anyway - characters in
Xenocide tend to have more hitpoints and miss more.

Agreed. And kevlar *pets* are a bit annoying. Or crazy citizens:
armor: human skin. "bullet hits without damage"

Like my own thoughts. I think most melee weapons should be weakened a
bit, for instance, I don't know if it's already implemented,
ADOM-style crowding bonus. Your melee fighting skills decrease for
each monster adjacent to you beyond one.

I think it should be allowed to roll. It's not much of
mental/concentration activity, after all. And for gameplay value, too.

Hmm. They are riot shields. Meant to stop rocks.

Yes, but if you played ADOM recently you know how silly it can look
sometimes. Trapped door destroys your only 2H sword, and suddenly your
barbarian is worthless now. Partially because Two-Handed-Weapons skill
has nothing to do with Swords in ADOM. But still...
More on topic: I think that formula for melee effectivenes (in
general, to hit and damage), should be something like skill*weapon,
not skill+weapon like in most roguelikes. The latter often leads to
silly situations where either weapon means very little (TOME - about
80% of your damage comes from skill, mo matter what kind of weapon you
use, wooden sword or well-balanced supersharp one).... or the
opposite.

Yeah, people still create new DooM mods and maps, and Duke Nukem 3D is
pretty much forgotten I think, after all this hype. No access to
source code.

There are people who use smileys instead of dots and semicolons.
Mostly girls... You can never be sure. Wait  - is Antti male or female
name ? ;-)

 Yes, I'm aware what Tom Hall originally named the BFG for. (Bit
> o'trivia: the BFG was originally a flamethrower-like version of the

You can even play with it if you download Press Release version of
Doom from doomworld.com.=20
Plasma gun is a bit different, too (uglier). Shoots both red and green
projectiles, I think.
That early BFG shoots in long bursts, and looks not so bad. They
changed it due to performance issues. If you download first alpha
versions of DooM, you can see clearly what had big impact on DooM's
popularity - see how ugly first weapon sprites were, and how crude
level design was. Same for wall textures. Pink demons were already
present very early, and even if they stand still and cannot be hit
they SHINE among the crude walls.

I'm not sure if there should be. If player wants to waste one turn
(equip) every time he encounters a monster, let him.
To make things funnier, equiping (big) weapons could take 2 or even 3
turns while in crawlspace :-). It's not like you have a lot of room to
maneuver with your backpack, right ?

There are simpler ways, without spoiling the fun. Think about progress
bars. Simple counter for passing turns should suffice - to assure
player that game didn't hang.

If you mean it could be just frustrating for some players, I think
there should still be classic buff pills left, just not as powerful.
So you could still be pretty buffed and able to control.
I'm a bit concerned about amount of pills player can take at same
time. If we keep adding new buff pills, player could have more
simultaneously - player can be more powerful, potentially. So there
could be some kind of cap, say you can only take 5 different
long-lasting pills at a time. It even makes sense from realistic view
- many drugs don't go well with others.

Kill you later !

-_- "Ville Mnkknen's Notrium"? I heard about it once, but haven't tried
it yet. Maybe I will, if only out of sheer patriotism. =^^=; I'm not a
great fan of real-time games, but one never knows beforehand what will
capture one's heart by surprise.

I was speaking from a strictly architectural viewpoint (I *love* floor
plans - I'm funny that way =^^=). And the Bunker doesn't have any actual
creatures yet - unless I've managed to miss a new version? Anyway, that's
an excellent point; and from what I know from experience and messing around
with Xeno's .def files (with a Polish dictionary to hand O_o), one that
Jakub has been following. There is a small chance of running into a Geno-
troid on the Shuttle, but in the Mines the buggers are everywhere (and
once the Hatchery gets added, well...). If there can be such a thing as
architectural predictability, taking Steve's suggestion of Ancient-style
ruins sprinkled with Enemy-style bunkers should avoid it beautifully.

Come to think of it, mixing different layout styles is such a great idea
that it might be worthwhile to think of other places where it could be
done. Some come to mind:
- The Crash Site, when it's only in the process of being turned into the
Sandkings' Castle.
- Add a living/break area to the Mines, modelled after the City or, perhaps
rather, the Lab.
- Isolated flooded areas in the Caves. (Maybe not such a big deal.)

That's true, now that you mention it. To be sure, there is some value to
having certain creatures always drop certain items (it is realistic to
expect that a miner will be carrying mining tools - and that you can loot
them off his corpse after killing him), but once it becomes predictable,
it ceases to be interesting. At the very least, some items would be broken
beyond usefulness when dropped, and armour worn by the guy you just killed
is likely to be in bad shape!

Heh! Sorry, but I'm going to take that at face value. I can tell you that
the desert demon Pazuzu was to the Mesopotamians a personification of the
south-east wind. It looked like a man, but with a scorpion's tail, the
wings (sometimes two pairs!) of an eagle, and the head of a dog (or lion).
As for the Lamia, it was a sort of ancient Greek vampire... a snake-like
creature (though some versions give it a goat- or lion-like body, or shape-
changing abilities) with the upper torso and head of a woman, which stole
little children and ate them, or drank their blood. Interestingly enough,
Bulgarians call something resembling the Greek Hydra Lamia; also, Basque
mythology has a friendly water-spirit by the same name.

A trivia buff, that's me. ^_^;

Nice ideas. Plus, if we have separate helmets, we should definitely have
at least one with a built-in targetting system (I can still recall how
fascinating the "Integral Helmet Sight" sounded in SSI's ancient sci-fi
CRPG Star Command - even if it was just a fancy name for an ordinary
piece of equipment)!

> > > #4 Unarmed fighting (global feature)

Granted, that's a promising way to approach the problem, and one that I
hadn't considered. Perhaps we should think of unarmed combat applications
less in terms of individual techniques, and more as generalised "firing
modes" (in this case, "combat modes"). Say, "offensive" (increasing the
chance that an attack will be a kick or other powerful type, at the cost
of defence), "defensive" (strengthening defences, while turning attacks -
and sometimes parries - into moving or immobilising techniques such as
throws and sweeps) and "countering" (performing creative tricks like pins,
throws and disarming when defending, while leaving the player's own attacks
unaffected). The program would probably still have to choose the actual
technique...

> All that would make unarmed fighting pointless. The point is about

My point exactly. A combat option like this has to be streamlined and a
pleasure, not a chore, to use, or the most die-hard kung-fu gamer won't
bother to use it, and the hard work needed to include such a system in a
game would be a waste.

Absolutely! If you meant the "exchange positions" technique to work like
I described for the Throw, I apologise: I had taken it to mean that you
would swap places with your target, which would hardly be useful to the
Spetsnaz (instead of letting you drag an enemy away from his comrades, it
would leave you in their middle and the target in that dark doorway)!

Ahh, I've been unclear again. I certainly did not mean that you shouldn't
be able to perform special moves on an enemy with a ranged weapon, but
rather than the program shouldn't choose a "Push" move when facing an
opponent with ranged combat capability. (It would be rather counterproductive
if you laboriously work your way up to a rifleman, dodging bullets, only to
knock him back and give him some more room to shoot you!) My whole point
was that if we're going to have a slew of special unarmed techniques, I
believe it best (or at least, the lesser of several evils) to leave it up
to the program to select a move and let the player concentrate on the
action.

> See ? ;]

"This is your father's lightsabre... Not as clumsy or random as a blaster."
^_^ Actually, this is something I've mentioned to Jakub before. The firearms
in Xenocide are way underpowered. I'm not entirely sure whether this is due
to accuracy, damage or insufficient skill, but I always seem to burn an
inordinate amount of ammunition just to take down some overgrown rodent.
(And I bristle at the message, "Bullet 8mm hits Rabid Prankster without
damage." I mean, do these critters have Kevlar fur or something? Speaking
of that message, Jakub - now that you have the swallowing message for pills
and effect message the correct way around, would it be possible to do the
same for damage messages? The hit message above would still be preceded by,
"Rabid Prankster gains no wounds." It looks a little odd.)

Of course, Marek's point can be taken as proof that Xeno balances melee and
ranged weapons so that it is up to the player's preference which to use.
Still, it strikes me as funny that someone would consider it safer to take
a wrench, instead of an assault rifle, to a crazed giant monster. Shouldn't
use of common sense (take it out before it gets close!) be rewarded, rather
than punished?

Hmmm... Would it be handled by disabling all commands other than movement?
(Perhaps with a cheeky message line, like "Not now, you're on fire!") What
if the player wanted to roll on the ground, whether by pressing "5" or
whatever? Would he then remain in place, or move in a random direction?
Yeah, I can see how it could work.

I'm not sure I see your point. Set the pro on fire, and he'll be screaming
just as much as the amateur. Like you said, anyone who is *on fire* will
be running around - not avoiding attacks. I don't think that the unpredict-
able movement will be enough to throw off the aim of anyone NOT on fire.
If anything, the human torch will be just as likely to run straight into
the attack (or trip over his own feet) as to zig-zag in a way that confuses
attackers.

I agree. (I just didn't want to bring up the point in that overlong email
because I felt I was already shooting down everybody else's ideas!) I don't
think Xenocide needs shields - but on the other hand, seeing as we have
riot shields in the "real" world today, if we happen across a fun way to
easily incorporate something similar in Xeno, why not go for it?

This is true, but I don't think we should fret about it. After discussing
implants with Jakub, I'd say they will more than make up for the lack of
magic, once implemented. (Also, let's not forget the fun things you can
do with the Genetic Machine. Talk about putting the control in the hands
of the player!) Then there's the fact that Roguelikes (all CRPGs) have
always been all about gaining better and better equipment. Not to say
that it's the only way to go about things, but there IS a reason why it
has endured so well - it works! (If anything, a SF game can be expected
to be /more/ gear-dependent than a fantasy game, since the technology is
a major part of what sets it apart from fantasy.)

One more thing. I'm fond of comparing RL games to good ol' Rogue (hey,
the genre isn't called ADOMlikes, Morialikes, or even Hacklikes - wonder
why?). In Rogue, there are no spells to be learned; magic only comes in
three forms: potions, scrolls, and wands/staves (in a way, enchanted weapons
and armour might also count, but they're more of a subclass, really).
Xenocide, at present, has pills (comparable to potions), grenades and
miscellaneous tools (somewhat comparable to wands), and the GenMachine
(comparable to scrolls by stretching it a bit). Xeno also has skills and
stats (Rogue doesn't), is going to have implants, and already has more
weapons, armour types, and monsters than Rogue. Rogue is still being
played, decades after its release. Will Xenocide still be remembered in
2025?

The moral: feature lists do not a game make.

*Sigh*... You know, generally speaking, that's what we use these smileys to
indicate. Yes, I'm aware what Tom Hall originally named the BFG for. (Bit
o'trivia: the BFG was originally a flamethrower-like version of the Plasma
Gun - called the "BFG 2704".) The very BFG FAQ you mentioned yourself, Marek,
was complete to the point of including William Whitaker's suggestion of an
alternate meaning for the initials (which I intend to make canon for my
infinity project, DOOM the RPG).

Whee! This would be a really cool addition, if it can be made to work
(and I'm getting more and more confident in Jakub's ability to make
things work ~_^). I don't think wind should affect shooting, or even
movement, all that much (though an abstract accuracy penalty could very
well be in order), but the very fact that smoke clouds can be blown away
by the wind would be something quite new. Oh, and what about fires
spreading with the wind? (You thought taking out that Death Blossom with
an incendiary grenade was a good idea. You should have checked the wind
first...)

ROFL. That's an awesome idea. I can just see it: popping an unknown pill,
you get "The world turns red..." and everything freezes for a while. A few
seconds later, you're on the other side of the screen with an axe in your
hands and a trail of bloody corpses marking your passage. That should freak
'em out... =^^=

Yes, I think such a berserk drug would best be handled by literally handing
over the control of the player to the program for the duration, not even
updating the screen until it's over. That's what blacking out feels like,
after all. If it turns out that the "frozen" period would last too long on
most computers (so people start thinking the computer has hung), the blind-
ing effect could be used (the player can see himself moving, but not items
or monsters), but it would be missing something. The problem with this is
that eventually, someone is going to get their character killed with this
pill, even with all the stat bonuses, and that can feel unfair (the game
just took over, and the next thing you hear is your own funeral march). I
think, however, that that can be alleviated with a suitable effect message
(something like "You took a berserk pill... hang on!", though I'm sure
Steve can come up with something more effective).

Wow! Another long email. No, I never learn. Goodnite!

Hi and welcome back on list.


> A word from the would-be nuclear physicist:

I recommend you reading Fallout manual... unles you have it printed
and hanged above your bed, which seems quite likely :-)

There is a simple solution. Try playing some MUDs, I guarantee that
you'll learn to type fast. I played Arkadia (polish), for some time,
then a bit of Barsawia, and Warlock (even less).
If you play(ed) classical RPG games, you may like them. My habit to
not use polish-specific characters comes mostly from MUDs, mostly one
MUD.
I no longer play MUDs because I can't stand severe technical
limitations. No bows, no horses, messy travel speed... <OT> Thats why
I learned to love Notrium. (http://monkkonen.net). It's very much
roguelike-like, or like(rogue + 1). Lots of random stuff, althrough
RNG is not so good. And 2D graphics is pretty nice. The game uses
complex stuff like food, temperature, energy, ammo management, in
REALTIME, and it's still very enjoyable and replayable ! The most
awesome thing for me is: the game is free, and very, very moddable,
with big capabilities you often don't see in roguelike games even. I'm
making 2 Notrium mods at the same time. One of them is playable, and
introduces new race - cold-blooded Salamander, which experiences
slowdowns or speedups depending on temperature. It can also see in
infrared, unique weapons and abilities, even graphics.... The mod is
called Funderful, and at the moment you can access it only via Notrium
forum.
Notrium has support for lots of funny things, like random or
semi-random maps, random map placement, item placement etc. It's so
great that you can even design workarounds for things supposedly not
possible, like checking which direction a creature faces. It has only
two serious flaws: poor pathfiding (limits AI), and line of
sight/bullet blockers are quite CPU-consuming. So it's mostly under
sky, almost no dungeons.

The same applies for writing area descriptions/events for MUDs. But
counter-reaction happens in your head. Subtle techniques are the best.

I haven't seen many roguelikes, but I must say I was amazed by that.
There's just one danger: don't make areas *too* specific, too
predictable. There should still be small chance of meeting monster
from one of adjacent areas.
One thing I miss in Xenocide is random item drops. Item drops are too
static. After a while I learned I have no reasons to check miner
corpses (other than for first mining suit). Items taken from miners
somehow don't feet my playing style. So I hardly ever check what they
drop, most often it's some kind of improvised melee weapon and armor,
sometimes small amount of shotgun ammo. I don't like having my melee
weapon limited by ammo, and I usually kill Mad Doc with wrench. A
habit from Quake 3 Fortress I guess.
In current version it's much easier to kill the doc with wrench than
with any ranged weapon, even using speed pill. I tried Assault Rifle,
Pistol, and Nail Gun in most devastating mode. Nailgun was most
effective, but he still regenerates too fast. Waste of ammo, and he's
not so good in melee as you might expect.

I can at least tell you that ones in Babylon looked like giant steps.
About 4-5 steps/levels per pyramid, and vertical walls of stone.
If you seek some ancient stuff, I suggest trying out Dominions2. It's
a strategy game, designed for hardcore players. I can't quite play it
for long, but sheer athmosphere and story keeps pulling me back. The
amount of text they put in there... it's very, very different from
most fantasy/medieval/ancient games, its different kind of fantasy,
more real. One of authors studied (or still is) history, and the other
- psychology. 
There are myriads of creatures you probably never heard of, and which
are - apparently - taken from real myths. You may know where Naga is
from (Indian myths), ghoul (arabic demon/shapeshiter), etc, but what
can you tell me about Pazuzu demon ? How about lamias ? Sometimes I
just turn it on, play for a while, and keep reading monster/item
descriptions. "(Bear claw) blah blah blah, increases strenght, blah
blah...  this is a very manly talisman, and it's believed that a woman
wearing it would get low voice, or even grow a beard"
One of races to play is R'lyeh (sp?), you may feel at home. You can
even summon stuff like Thing Of Many Eyes, Elder Thing, Great
Vastness, Astral Horrors.. Demo weights 80MB.

I've been thinking about "head slot" items. 
How about:

Combat Helmet - a bit higher chance to block criticals, on par with
mining helmet. Integrated targeting system

Rhino Helmet - no fancy targeting, highest critical hit prevention of
all helmets

Gas mask - low critical prevention, the rest just like you'd expect
from gas mask

Weasel Helmet - stuff like better stealth, better hearing sense, etc.
Let me check my notepad... Oh well, it's not integrated into Xenocide.

One and only game I didn't manage to finish on PC was Alien vs
Predator. Partially because of crappy console-like saving, but mostly
because the game was damn scary.

For first few minutes of game you don't see anything but damaged metal
and blinking, damaged lights. You keep looking here and there, and...
find nothing.
Then the scanner picks up some kind of movement. By the time it
detects something (35 m), you can already hear it. It scares you more
than it helps.
I played as alien and predator for some time, but quickly got bored.
It's just no the same.

All that would make unarmed fighting pointless. The point is about

Do you consider exchange positions an useful move ? I've been trapped
by hordes of monsters in ADOM too many times. Other uses I already
described:
- there's a room full of ranged enemies, and somehow they want to keep
their advantage instead of attacking you one-by-one. So you jump from
behind a corner, grab one of them and drag into corridor. Your enemies
stand frozen in terror and listen to terrible screams coming from the
other room. Then some kind of object bounces off the floor. Upon
closer examination, it appears to be a human head. Head of guy you
talked to minute ago.
I know, I know sounds like methods russian Spetznaz actually uses
against terrorist in hostage missions...
Then there's stuff like pushing monster into a room and closing the
door. Very useful yet hard to perform in Xenocide due to fact most
monsters are at least as fast as player.
Disarming an enemy who wields ranged weapon seems very useful. Would
work against most humanoids. I think you wrote something along the
lines "ranged weapon should prevent special melee attacks". Why's that
? I think it should be represented by fact tht you have to come close
to enemy, and may take hits in process.

So I suggest that unarmed fighting would be as much a weapon as a
tool.

Last game using this principle is Battle For Wesnoth, and, despite man

special about 10 new units per version if they differ (almost only) in
hp, number of attacks, attack damage and picture ?

Don't be afraid, I'll probably integrate it into my Notrium mod. Not
directly, because it can't really be done in Notrium, but I can make
one creature change into another basing on some conditions (only once
at map generation), including "random integer between 0 and parameter0
is 0"
So I would need to create several versions of same creature differing
only in resists.
I really recommend Notrium modding, it's so easy that such a lame C
coder like myself can learn it reasonably well in several games. Yet
so powerful and versatile...

So-called addition is present in ADOM, as far as I remember. 
That would be just like confusion. I'd like to have two stages of
"losing control": confusion effect would be the higher one, and lower
would simply require you to move, but with possibility to choose
direction.

Umm, I dunno. There are quotes like "fear amateurs. Proffesionals are
predictable". More or less it applies here. You can't exactly predict
how a burning man is going to behave. But you know for sure he'll be
running VERY fast.

Two birds with one rock. "Two birds with one rock is good luck, two
rocks with one shot is good tactics!" - Boulderdash quote from
Sacrifice.

 > > *** SHIELDS ***

Yeah, could possibly be done. But some things bother me:

- SF games quite often mimic fantasy games. We don't have a shield ?
We have to have a shield, how about mega-hiper-steel and so on ?
No magic - let's introduce PSI. I'm quite happy that Jakub doesn't
seem eager to implement PSI. I'm curious how well roguelike game can
fare without magic.

There's another thing concerning me.
Hole left after "removing" magic should somehow be filled. I don't
mean implementing psi, but there should be more alternatives to
character development. Alternatives which are partially exclusive (you
can't develop weapon skills very well if you spend time on casting
spells, too). I'll try my best to remedy that.
At the moment there's one way of development in xenocide, I think:
find big guns. (and heavy armor, but I wanted it to be short and
blunt). There will be some messing with implants, I think, too. (CHECK
OUT perk/level system from Crimsonland ! It's fun !). More about
Crimsonland - you guys seem so huge on high-tech stuff, you'll love
that game. Plasma/Ion/Gauss shotguns/rifles/miniguns...26 or so
weapons. there are conventional weapons, too (of which the best, I
think, is the auto shotgun), just not as useful. Post your records
:-). A quote from the game: "You treat your own bullets with rat
poison. You do it for good luck, but it happens to have some side
effects".   <-------      :D

> "blast field gun" - that's what BFG stands for, right? Right? ^_^;)

In case you'renot kidding - either Big Freakin' Gun, or Big Fucking
Gun. Even guys at ID use both.

=====================================
Fresh stuff goes here
====================================

1. Crawlspace tiles
 - would reduce your speed basing on weapon class wielded. Purpose -
underline differences between weapons, make "lower" weapons useful
even later, fun in general, athmosphere.
Pisols wouldn't reduce speed at all, or reduction would be small.
Rifles would reduce speed moderately.
Big, heavy guns would mean big speed penalty.
My suggestion is that this terrain should be placed instead of some
walls, so that entering it is not necessary, but can help you
ocassionaly.

2. Desert Wind (or wind in general, in open)
I think a nice addition would be some kind of wind. It would be
defined by just two parameters: speed and direction. It would be best
if direction could change dynamically.
Wind would affect smoke, gas, fire (not so much because napalm is
supposed to be sticky, right?). No need to use particle system, I
guess it would be possible to change shape of smoke cloud. From circle
to elipse. Shape of elipse dependant on speed.
- bullets could be affected by wind, but not as much as smoke and gas.
You may need to compensate for wind to hit.
- you may go slower against the wind, and a bit faster with wind.

3. New grenades (improvised?)
These grenades would probably be very hard to find, or impossible.
You'd need skills like chemistry, engineering and such.
- fake proximity grenade: to fool smart enemies. They would avoid fake
proximity grenades, unless they see player or any other creature near
it. Or some other logical stuff. That would give away the secret, that
particular monster would not be fooled by that fake again, to the end
of time.
- pressured paint grenade - messy stuff. As strange as it sounds, I
managed to find some uses for it.1: tag invisible monsters to make
them easier to target; 2: create clouds while underwater; 3: cover
translucent object to fool monsters. You could paint a glass window,
plastic door, this kind of stuff to make it block line of sight.
Unless LOS is player-only. 4: perhaps blind some robots permanently,
since they have no hands to wipe face with.
- flask of oil - does nothing by itself, but area or enemy hit by it
can be set on fire. Stuff covered by oil burns much more violently,
but doesn't ignite on its own.
- robot decoy - I know, already suggested before, but it would be
useful in form of grenade.

4. Mag deflector - like in Scorched Earth. Deflects bullets, mostly
ballistic stuff. Works much better at longer distance. Doesn't help
against melee. Drains energy. 

5. True berserk - you want some serious buff ? Take this berserk pill.
Very nice stat increase, but:
- player loses control over himself, totally
- to make it even cooler - PC doesn't remember anything from berserk.
Simply acomplished by "blinding" effect. Nothing can be seen while
berserk lasts. No problem at all because turns can be accelerated (no
need of player imput, turns are executed automatically).
So when Berserk wears off, you suddenly find yourself surrounded by
corpses of dead enemies.
Should automatically equip melee weapon. In my Notrium mod berserking
player can still see (but no control, no inventory access etc),
because I can't really prevent that. Perhaps I can make
non-transulcent light. But sounds still can't be disabled.

6. More about fire. Short one this time:
Being on fire should grant melee bonuses. Burning creature may be even
more dangerous sometimes.

7. I don't quite like the way area grenades work.
a) Gas should go around the corners, fire from napalm shouldn't
(sticky)
b) gas doesn't spread when pressured. I mean, in Xenocide. If you
throw a gas grenade into a corridor, it will affect about 5 squares
only. And I don't think it even deals more damage than supposedly the
same amount of gas spread of larger area. I know calculating damage
basing on pressure sounds stupid,(hassle to code) but something could
be done about spreading.

Hey look, I'm back. Whew... what's a six-month backlog between friends? ^_^;
I'll try to catch up a little. (See if you can still remember what was said
back then...) I tried to go easy on the opinions, but a few slipped in anyway,
on the off chance that Jakub hasn't made firm decisions on all points... I'm
sorry if this sounds like I suddenly come from nowhere and start throwing
around comments on everything, but I wanted to get a lot of things out of the
way.
(Note to self: respond to individual items in separate, short emails, instead
of trying to cover everything in one fell swoop...)

[Steve:]
> And Antti, I'm still waiting to hear from you, my Finnish friend ;D And I

Particle beams... Well. The idea behind particle accelerator weapons (PAWs)
is "simply" using as projectiles sub-atomic particles magnetically accelerated
to relativistic speeds. They guzzle up horrible amounts of energy, but are
fairly powerful. They deliver simple kinetic damage, and also cause a surface
explosion in hard materials. The release of energy produces radiation - not
enough to cause radiation poisoning, but enough to scramble electronics. They
also have some recoil (perhaps comparable to a .22 calibre rifle), because at
a velocity approaching the speed of light, even sub-atomic particles have
mass.

The "default", and simpler, version of PAW uses charged particles, which are
guided to the target by a relatively low-power laser beam which ionises the
air, creating a "path of least resistance" for the particles to travel down.
(Charged particles are of little use in vacuum, as they repel each other,
breaking up the beam, and neutral particles need to be used instead - which
require a heavier, more complex accelerator. But we needn't worry about this,
as there won't be any areas of vacuum in Xenocide... will there?)
A fairly concise explanation (written in 1984!) can be found here:
<www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1984/jul-aug/roberds.html>

In game terms, particle "blasters" would, in all probability, be on a par with
plasma weapons as described by Steve (though I disagree with making energy
weapons so powerful... grenades and rockets should, IMO, inspire awe even
after beam weapons are introduced... and not just because of their area
effect), only with longer range (though nothing approaching laser ranges) and
lower damage. The radiation surge would perhaps be best handled as a special
effect that stuns robots on a hit (duration could simply be based on armour
value, on the assumption that military robots, the best-armoured kind, would
also have hardened internal circuitry). Carried models would probably only
be capable of single shots.

> What if implants were just like normal equipment in any roguelike, with

This is exactly the way I always thought these things would best be handled,
only Steve expressed it better than I ever could (as usual). I'm all for this
idea. There should, I think, be a separate screen for all installed implants
(unless they can be fitted on the "character information" screen), since they
wouldn't really be part of the inventory. Ones that can be turned on or off
at will could then be activated (as Steve elsewhere suggested, again very
sensibly) from that screen.

On the other hand, body *implants* generally also involve all of the body, so
it could be argued that the body should have the same number of slots as all
others. Or maybe not =^^=

Me too. The only problem I see with it is the too-easy availability of
self-recharging batteries. This is especially noticeable with the "test
player" (who only needs to turn his armour off for a couple of turns to fully
recharge its battery), but also affects normal play. Once you get to the City,
all you have to do is grab the nearest shotgun or rifle, make a brief foray
into the mines, kill a handful of miners and steal their Mining Batteries -
and the first chainsaw you see. It's likely to be the only power-draining item
you have, and now you're all set to take the Lab by storm. (Okay, maybe I
exaggerate a little...) I think that at least for the first half or so of the
game, the emphasis should be on non-recharging batteries of varying capacity
and mass.

On a purely semantic level, should we reserve a single descriptor for energy
storage devices with no recharge capability (say, "battery"), and another for
self-recharging ones (say, "powercell")? This way, the uses of the different
varieties will be instantly recognisable to the player. Will there be a
separate item (say, a "generator") that adds to the recharge rate of carried
storage devices, without having any storage capacity of its own? (Hey, how
about a three-way division: batteries that cannot be recharged, ones that can
but won't do so on their own, and a recharger that will recharge batteries of
the latter type? Sounds an awful lot like real life, I know. O_o)

This is the "brute force" method of creating plasma weapons (you ionise some
hydrogen gas and expel a wash of it out of a hose at high pressure), but there
are other ways. One is related to the working method of particle weapons
discussed above. Insted of simply ionising the air, a more powerful laser is
used to burn a vacuum tunnel through air, and immediately releasing a burst of
plasma down it. Presto: a more focussed plasma blast with greater range
(albeit at greater energy consumption). Another method is similar, but instead
of a laser, involves a magnetic field (after all, one is required anyway to
store the plasma) projected towards the target in a tunnel-like shape.
(Whether this is easier or harder than using a laser, or even feasible at all,
is debatable.) Finally, there may be a way to use a laser, again, to vapourise
a solid cartridge into plasma-like form and fire that... but I've only seen
that method discussed in one source, and for all I know, it may have been a
terminal case of the science-fantasy techo-babbles.

I like this one, and would suggest to make it an actual future blowtorch. The

the more the game will feel like a fight for survival instead of high-tech
hack-n-slash.

If I read correctly, your suggestion is to make the "wave" simply a burst in
game terms? Simple enough, but how about an "actual spreader cannon" (for some
reason, I'm a sucker for this kind of gun - in games, I should add ^_^;) that
fires a flamethrower-like cone or, better yet, an advancing, arc-shaped, wide
"shockwave" of plasma? (Don't ask me how such a thing could be created, but it
would certainly look cool!)

They certainly are. ^_^ Anyway, I don't think a five-shot firing mode would be
a worthwhile addition. The burst fire mode already fires a half-dozen or more
shots (and feels just the right kind of chaotic for autofire), so a controlled
burst of five shots would be hard to justify.

Oh, yeah. We simply must have at least one... something... called "Dragoon".
Preferably something having to do with spitting flaming death... Explanation:
it seems that the Japanese really like to confuse the word "dragoon" with the
word "dragon", and, well, the current generation of Roguelikes owes Japanese
console RPGs at least for a cautionary example, so... *sheepish grin*

The above holds true, but with an important distinction: railguns use
different ammo from conventional firearms, some two to ten times lighter. This
is because a railgun round only has to contain the projectile and no
propellant.
(For some reason, I now feel the urge to quote Greg Porter's excellent RPG
Macho Women With Guns: "Some games feel they need to tell you this. If you
needed to be told this, then I have some valuable swamp^D^D^D^D^D coastal

Again, since the muzzle velocity of a railgun round does not depend on
propellant, there is precious little point in firing a solid slug with a
discarding sabot. The most likely load for this kind of weapon would thus be
an explosive grenade, making this an electromagnetic grenade launcher (EMGL).
"Rail caster" does sound much cooler, though...

This is a fun idea. I would go so far as to suggest that the Aura Bug be given
no attack forms whatsoever, simply making it a mobile radiation hazard.
(Furthermore, I think the 'Bug should be relatively weak and easy to kill...
only it appears in great numbers... and they all *really like the player*!) I
just like the idea of including _some_ creatures that AREN'T out for the

Yes! The idea of hiding a killer plant among identical, harmless shrubbery
(just had to use that word ^_^) is perfect for atmosphere. The problem is that
the 'Blossom would then have to be sessile, as walking about would give it
away pretty quickly, and given the size of the Xenocide game screen, it might
be too easy for the player to simply avoid all bushes. (Not that it would not
be fun to see the player skirting around every harmless shrub in his
paranoia...) But perhaps the 'Blossom could be given a tentacle-like vine to
lash out with, out to a range of several tiles? Or alternately, just make it
"come alive" and start moving only when the player comes too close.

So why not simply use "irradiate"? To quote the Collins Cobuild English

large amount of radioactivity; a technical term." Sounds to me like just the
thing. (Of course, "give radiation poisoning to" would be more technically
accurate, but...)

For what it's worth: I don't like this. I really hate it in Dungeon Crawl and
other games when a monster pops up and attacks, leaving me with X-ray vision
and a tail on the posterior. I just want to have more choice in the matter
than simply deciding whether to attack or run away from this particular
creature. (I know... a control freak, that's what I am.)

A word from the would-be nuclear physicist: Ordinary background radiation
isn't likely to produce this kind of radioactivity. Real radiation is
dangerous - it produces sterility and terminal illness much more often than
survivable mutations. Not to mention the fact that if the magnetic field of
the planet is so weak that it lets through such amounts of solar radiation,
the planet's gravity would also have to be weak - so weak, in fact, that the
planet wouldn't be able to retain an atmosphere.

But there are other possible sources of radioactivity. Perhaps the likeliest
is some sort of commonly-occurring radioactive mineral. This could even result
in dangerous radiation "hotspots" centred around clusters of such a mineral.
Also, this question of the radioactive desert begs the question - is the
entire planet covered in this vast radioactive desert (apart from the domed
City), or is this just an isolated stretch?

The superlative: "...is THE most hideous".

Guess I'll have to become an English teacher after all. ^_^; But really, the
description as a whole is wonderful. It's good that it is long, since this is
not only a unique creature, but a "Boss Monster". (The descriptions of
ordinary monsters are better kept short, though.) There's just one thing about
the last bit, about the intent to kill and the fear inside you. I think the
Doctor's intent to kill is best conveyed through his rants and taunts. Also,
in my experience from pen-and-paper RPGs, telling the players how frightened
their characters are never works. If anything, it produces a counter-reaction:
"No, I'm not afraid! I charge bravely forward!" (What works much better is
simply describing an obviously dangerous situation - but not springing it on
the characters right away. By the time the crunch comes, the players have
thought it over several times and have scared *themselves* spitless. >:) )
Finally, I'd remove the "he draws nearer" bit as well. When I play a
Roguelike, as often as not I charge into combat with a new acquaintance right
away, and only stop to read any descriptions later - for example, when it
turns tail and runs, wounded. At such a time, it would seem silly if the
description talks ominously about the slowly advancing monstrosity...

Jakub, tell me if I got it completely wrong, but I assumed that even in the
desert, every map will still be one screen in size (more or less); and that it
is only when the player approaches the edge and "walks over" it, that the next
map-screen is generated. (Continuous centring in a full-screen ASCII mode is
not a good idea, the refresh rate would be arduous.) Thus, there is no chance
of a monster off-screen attacking the player, since there can be no monsters
on a map that has not even been generated yet. Just like an ordinary "area"
(like, say, the Lab), only the "levels" are next to, and not on top of, one
another. Which brings to mind: are the desert maps, like any other map, saved
so that you can trace your steps back?

I think I do. As long as you keep walking from one desert screen to another,
new ones will be created for you to explore. There is a 12% likelihood
(3%+3%+3%+3%, above) that the screen you arrive at is one of the pregenerated
ones, otherwise it's just random desert. However, I think that this chance
should be higher (especially if the desert maps are to be saved, and/or the
desert is more-or-less open terrain), or otherwise "fudged" in some way.
Otherwise, the time a player has to spend in the desert will be unbearably
long, without any real sense of progress. Also, I'm not sure what to think of
the idea that even the (re)appearance of the City entrance is randomised.
While it's realistic to allow the player a chance to get lost in the desert, a
3% chance of finding the City again sounds to me more like a certainty of
getting lost. (It would also lead to a situation where you are more likely to
find the City in front of you, walking away from it, than trying to backtrack
to where you came from.)

For this reason, I suggest the following. Assign a direction to each of the
major features of the desert. (How convenient: there are four of them.) For
example, the City to the east, the Crash Site to the west, the Ancient Ruins
to the north, and the Bunker to the south. Wherever you enter the desert (it
seems that you can enter the desert either from the City or through the
bunker, even though this was not indicated in the old level schematic Jakub
once sent us), the likelihood of that "direction" is set to 100%, all others
to 0%. (This percentage indicates how likely it is that you arrive at the
entrance screen assigned to that direction.) When you exit that screen, the
percentage for the direction you leave in is increased by, say, 10%; the one
for the opposite direction is decreased by a similar amount; and the other two
are halved. Before the new map is generated, the percentage chance *for the
direction you are headed in* is checked, and if "successful", that entrance
will be placed there for you to find. Thus, as long as you keep walking in a
certain direction, you _will_ come across _something_ - but the longer you go
in one direction, the longer you (probably) have to go in another direction to
find something else.

An example may be in order. (This is why I /cannot/ become a teacher: I can
never explain anything in a way that makes sense to anybody.) Assume the
numbers given above; N, S, E, W are the percentages for the four directions.
                                N    S    E    W
Enter the desert from the City  0%   0%   100% 0%
Walk west                       0%   0%   90%  10%
Walk north                      10%  -10% 45%  5%
Walk west again                 5%   -5%  35%  15%
Walk west some more             2%   -2%  25%  25%
Walk south                      -8%  8%   12%  12%

And so on. By wandering around, you will only end up walking in circles; by
going in one direction at a time, you will be rewarded. (Note that if, after
walking one screen to the west from the City, we had returned one screen to
the east, the chance for the City entrance would have gone back to 100%, and
we'd have been safe. On the other hand, if we had tried returning east after
going west once and north once, the chance of finding our way back would only
have been 55%.)

Let's put this one in capitals: I LIKE IT! This is entirely unlike how I had
envisaged the Ruins, but my ideas were so nebulous that this is much better.
This will really help set apart the Ruins from all the other areas, and that's
what different areas should be all about, eh? (This might not be a good time,
but I'll mention it anyway: have you noticed how masterfully Jakub has
manipulated his random-dungeon engine to give each of the randomly-generated
areas seen so far a very unique character? Now that I've actually seen the
Enemy Bunker, I must say that somehow the floorplans for it look very
effectively "bunker-like". If he can keep this up, the finished Xenocide
should become famous for the personality of its "dungeons" alone!) I like the
idea of placing "pillars" and statues along corridors. It will help create a
really majestic feel to the Ruins. (Of course, the pillars and statues will
have to be further apart than in Steve's picture, above, but the principle is
good.) There would probably be quite a lot of wide, straight corridors
connecting geometrically-shaped halls and rooms.

You know, the griffin was a Mesopotamian invention. So perhaps other
Mesopotamian influences would fit in as well. (It would be "different", too.
Usually, when talking about Ancients and temples and such, most often the
influences are Egyptian in nature. Probably due to the mystery of the
pyramids.) Unfortunately, I have very little idea of what Mesopotamian temples
looked like. Oh, yeah: I find the idea of living rock griffins a worthy
addition. (In the silly little "horror" film, "The Haunting", they had wooden
griffins that were very nicely made. This reminds me of them.)

A nasty pair, this. I love 'em. (Well, the annoying little play-balance freak

"wrong" kind of weapon, only more difficult... but I'm not listening to it!)
The name "Matter Lord" smacks a little of Diablo, but I can't help it, it's
wonderfully evocative. "Angelesque" is simply a stellar name.

Would it be possible to situate these things in pools of light (just three by

(let in by carefully-crafted vents and skylights) into a laser-like beam of
coherent light.

Myself, I'm not crazy about this idea (it might be better to underline the
non-presence of the Ancients by only having them present in one,
out-of-the-way location) - though I must confess I find the idea very
intriguing of having Ancient-style ruins "overlaid" with decidedly Enemy-style
enclaves, like mini-Bunkers. But can the map generation engine handle it?

Absolutely! Few things were more fun in "Jedi Knight" (Dark Forces II) than
grabbing goodies off a shelf using Force Pull (or, for that matter, pulling
blasters out of the hands of Stormtroopers)... except, perhaps, using Force
Push to shove Stormtroopers off ledges (falling off high ledges seems to be an
occupational hazard for many bad-guy soldiers). So, if we are going to have
this level of gravity-manipulation technology, why not incorporate a "pressor
beam mode" in the same device, which could push items (like enemies, or
grenades thrown by them) away, instead of pulling them to you?

Technically, this should be called a "total-conversion power unit" (from the
fact that it directly converts matter totally into energy). And, it's really,
really advanced technology, probably best left for an Ancient device... Oh,
bugger - isn't this exactly what the Utility Bot does with its Garbage

Speaking of the searchlights, I'm not entirely sure how this works right now,
but if a "monster" (like a hapless Miner) stumbles in a searchlight's way,
shouldn't the bunker guns open fire on it? (This, after all, is the way
countless action film heroes have been warned of automated defence systems!)
Otherwise, does the line-of-sight calculation allow for targetting a monster
that is out of your "light radius" but highlighted by a searchlight?

While I'm all for the idea of a "spy remote", don't these two overlap a bit
too much with ordinary attack and bomb robots? Oh, and Jakub, didn't you once
mention plans of a "sticky camera" you could throw at a monster and then see
the area around it, as well as yourself, on the map? Such an item could easily
be used with friendly robots as well, to extend their usefulness.

Not only that, but the message when turning off a powered item is, for

does that sound just a tad stilted?

Welll... I kind of assumed that the "HE Grenade" is, in fact, a frag grenade.
In real life, what the U.S. military calls a "concussion grenade" (of which
the "flash-bang" is a version) is in fact a high-explosive grenade without a
fragmentation lining. The Xeno "HE Grenade" produces a cinematic explosion
that is more like a real-life incendiary grenade. But then, if including a
"particle tracing" grenade is as easy as Jakub claims, I'm all for keeping
both the Frag and the HE in the game, and brushing off the latter as simply
some kind of high-tech "shockwave" explosive.

That said, I must agree with Steve that having the fragments drop off in
lethality with range is a good idea. For one thing, that's what fragments do
in the real world. More to the point, it's one thing to include a nasty piece
of hardware in the game, and another altogether to cause annyoing, pointless
player deaths by faraway fragmentation explosions (possibly ones the player
caused himself... remember that the throwing distance isn't all that long,
currently).

A further point about fragments: they should probably have a chance (something
like 90%) of hitting a creature (or object?) in their path. This way, even if
you manage to throw a grenade right underneath a monster, one or two fragments
would still escape to injure bystanders; and, on the other pseudopod, there is
a chance (however slim) that a frag grenade exploding right beside you might
still leave you unscathed. Both of which happen in real life.

> #2 Silence (creature ability)
>
This one I love. IIRC, it has been Jakub's intention from the start to make
Xenocide the kind of tech-horror found in the film "Alien" (or perhaps more
akin to "Aliens", what with all these big guns around...). Horror is all
about fear; fear is all about atmosphere; and atmosphere is more (MUCH more)
than bloody corpses strewn all about the place. Having a creature like this
(incredibly dangerous, yet more than completely silent) helps a lot in
putting the player on edge. (I know that in my table-top RPGs, I've upped
the tension level many, many times simply by stating, "You know, you haven't
heard any birds singing for a while now." @_@)

> #4 Unarmed fighting (global feature)

> Tricks available for highly skilled unarmed fighters:

Well, like Steve, I happen to like Sonic Fists and Hiryuu Shoten-ha
techniques, but no, I don't think such things would be quite at home in
Xenocide... ^_^; Unfortunately, I have a couple of problems with Marek's
suggestions, fine as they were. One is purely pragmatic: how would one perform
all of these stunts in the game? Would we need a specialised martial-arts
screen and/or interface with its own command keys? Yecch. Or would the game
suggest a technique when you attack a suitable monster barehanded ("Would you
like to do a Body Flip [y/n]?"), or maybe pick the most likely (i.e. random)
one and perform it without asking the player? The former will slow down the
game, the latter result in some inappropriate manoeuvres.

Then there's the more general question... Is there really any reason to
include an "Unarmed Fighting" skill in the first place, other than for that
one player who'll eventually try it? (Oh, and for compatibility with unarmed
monsters, of course.) I mean, every character starts with some kind of melee
weapon, and others are readily available. The "special moves" discussed here
would have to be pretty darn useful (AND available from the very beginning),
otherwise developing the unarmed combat skill will be more trouble than it's
worth. (This is easier said than done, if we are limiting ourselves outside
lame shortcuts such as low-probability quick-kill moves - whether termed Force
Kicks and Blooming Cherry Fists, or Neck Snaps and Backbreakers.)

All that said, I do have an actual suggestion to make. First of all, the
system has to be changed so that if you have no ready weapon, "e"xchanging
from the wielded weapon will make you unarmed. This will make it possible to
perform surprise moves in between weapon attacks. (It's surprising how few
games are even prepared to handle the time-honoured kick to the kneecap while
fighting with melee weapons.) Then, make sure that the "surprise" factor
actually counts (the fact that ranged weapons have a melee defence of +0 is
already a step in the right direction). Now, draw up a limited (4-6 items)
list of "special moves" and the exact conditions under which each applies. The
list must be short to make sure that each technique is actually useful, and
exacting so that there is NO overlap under any circumstances (failing that,
make it an ordered list where the first applicable move is always picked).
When the player (or an intelligent monster) attacks without a weapon, the list
is checked, and if the situation warrants it, a special move is performed
automatically; otherwise, an ordinary +0/+0/+0 attack is launched.

Some of these "special moves" might include:
- Push (or Thrust Kick): knocks the target away from the player one space.
Requirements: strength more than target weight/8000, target must not have a
ranged weapon!
- Throw/Flip: moves the target to the exact opposite side of the player (note
that this essentially works the same as Marek's "exchange places" move). Has a
50% chance to Stun the target. Requirements: dexterity more than target
weight/10,000
- Sweep: Stuns the target (or knocks it to the ground, if stances are ever
implemented). Requirements: strength more than target dexterity, target must
be capable of motion (which implies an upright posture)
- Kick: an ordinary attack, but at +3 damage and -1 to hit. Requirements:
speed more than the target's
These are just examples, and can be improved in a thousand ways (e.g., make
the Push distance relative to the square root of the ratio of attacker
strength to target weight/8000; base the Stun likelihood of the Throw on
250%/target endurance; add situational requirements, so that a move isn't
repeated time after time), but this is the principle. What do you guys think?

The pen-and-paper method and the switch-to-Notepad method of taking notes are
both useful, but both have the same failing: if you take a long break from the
game, both kinds of notes may get lost. Having an in-game notepad that is
saved along with the character data would make sure that the notes you need to
remind yourself where you were and from where you came, will always be
available. (For space/memory reasons, it will probably be necessary to limit
the notepad in some way, e.g. limiting one note to one line on the screen, and

I like Jakub's idea. I would also suggest adhering to the KISS principle
(Keep It Simple, Stupid!), so that the bonus to be gained from an autopsy
should be something like a 10% increase in the likelihood of scoring critical
damage on that type of monster (or simply a damage bonus). To be fair, I
must point out that if I was making a game of my own, I would probably go
for Marek's suggestion of randomising the resists of creatures every game,
just like pills and grenades - I love random numbers (in the set-up phase
of a game, mind you). Then again, most of my own game projects tend to fail
miserably, so... ^_^;

I do have to point out (always the Devil's advocate, me) that in all
likelihood, semiautomatic fire in Xenocide is *not* a one-to-one simulation
of real life (oh!). After all, a trained user can fire up to about four to
six semiautomatic shots per second - and I don't think the Xenocide turn is
supposed to represent a mere 0.3 seconds? The limiting factor, therefore, is
not the mechanical action of the weapon, but the time the player takes to
aim, stabilise the weapon from the recoil of the previous shot, take a quick
look around, and so on. All of these "invisible" actions are performed in
less time when the player's metabolism is sped up.

Now, this is somewhat less the case with automatic weapons, which CAN be fired
on constant full auto (this is, I think, what Marek is getting at with his
point about miniguns). Of course, fully automatic fire is considered to be a
fine way to waste prodigious amounts of ammunition, and not much else; recoil
alone spoils the firer's aim after two or three shots. For this reason, I like
to think of "Burst Mode" fire in Xenocide as a series of short bursts in quick
succession... in which case, finally, it IS possible to fire faster if the
firer is "hastened". (And /anyway/, the term "burst fire" itself refers to
*controlled bursts*; a "constant hail of lead" is called "firing on full
automatic".)

Being on fire should definitely be enhanced somehow, and forced movement seems
a good way to do it. I agree with Marek that a separate "roll on the ground"
command would not be a very useful addition (though, having it, other uses
could be thought up for it - such as a deposit of a special mud somewhere
that can be used to give the player a fireproof coating, say, if he thinks
of "rolling" in it...). I would keep things simple by making a burning player
behave as in Rogue when confused (I believe NetHack, ADOM, and others have the
same kind of mechanism, but I have no experience with them): every time the
player tries to move, the direction is randomised; only with the addition that
the player moves in a random direction even when hitting the "rest" key
(which, incidentally, doubles as the "roll" key, as it were). Oh, and set the
player's Defence rating to zero for good measure (watch out for that Sentry
G...).

Oh, it might be worthwhile to respect the distinction between sealed and
unsealed suits of armour. I assume that at least some forms of powered armour
would be sealed (airtight). Such armour would give complete protection from
flame, at least for a while (depending on its degree of actual fireproofing).
Therefore, should the suit itself catch fire, the wearer would still be able
to function normally - until the flame burns through the suit.

In other words, a typical two-tiered system of Skills ("lower skills") and

I'm a bit divided here, but I think I agree with Marek. Xenocide already has a
"learning-by-doing" system of skill development (unless Jakub is resolved to
get rid of it), so wouldn't it make sense if the time put into one skill shows
in related skills? (It's also nice to show the player his actual
advancement...)

I'll just have to pop in my two cents' worth, here. See, I prefer it the other
way around. I'm intimidated by long lists of skills. I never know whether a
certain situation occurred because of my level in some esoteric skill, or
whether it was purely random. Then again, it seems that Jakub has already made
his mind up about the revised skill system, so what am I whining for? ^_^;

Wouldn't that make it too powerful? Of course, it depends on how efficient it
is at destroying organic matter. If it reduces the target to vapour on a
successful hit, then I'd strongly advise against letting it pass through
armour...!

A real vacuum does not turn your insides out or make your eyeballs explode
instantly. So, unless this one creates a vacuum for a very long time somehow,
I suspect that it would mainly cause damage from the air rushing in. (The
sudden lack of air might badly Stun breathing creatures, though.)

I belong to the school that thinks weapon skills should be divided according
to method of use and not type of damage. After all, a shovel, an axe, and a
big hammer are all used in the same way - by swinging the shaft and trying to
connect with the head. (And the way to use a bayonet attached to a rifle is
the exact same motion as thrusting with a spear.) It does not matter, really,
that some have cutting edges and some don't. Therefore, my suggestion for a
basic division of melee weapons would be something like short blades/long
blades/hafted weapons/thrusting weapons/pole arms. That should cover most
muscle-powered weapons in five handy categories.

[Steve:]
> *** AIMING ***
>
Hear, hear! Xenocide should definitely include the option to aim a gun
(though I don't see why it shouldn't work for melee attacks as well).
However, I think here we have a situation somewhat akin to the one with the
"roll on the ground" command. Since you cannot do anything else than stand
still while aiming, and lose the benefit if you move, why not simply base
the aiming bonus on the number of consecutive turns spent doing nothing but
pressing "5" before taking a shot? (Perhaps the bonus could be halved, or
divided by rate of fire+1 or something, after each attack? And reduced to
zero if the player moves or switches targets...) There should be a cap, of
course, perhaps based on the weight of the weapon (since light guns like
pistols tend to sway more), or possibly by introducing a "law of diminishing
returns" like, say, +1 for one turn of aiming, +2 for two more turns, +3
after four more...

It should be borne in mind that an armour-piercing effect, in most cases, is
achieved by concentrating more force over a smaller area. In other words, an
AP bullet will go right through many materials - but it will leave a really
small hole, damaging the object itself very little (in exchange for going on
to hit anything beyond).

This subject reminds me of something. I recently played Master of Orion for
the first time. (So call me behind the times. I call myself retro-gaming
oriented. ^_^;) It is such a wonderful game that I feel it's well worth paying
homage to. For example, we might mention that a shield, or an advanced type of
armour, is made of "andrium" or "tritanium" (maybe not "zortrium" ^_^)... and
see if anybody notices.

Wow! As usual, Steve has put some real effort into his suggestions. Un-
fortunately, I'm not convinced that Xenocide needs this kind of complexity.
In most CRPGs that implement diseases, there is simply the status condition
"Diseased", which more often than not, just means that the sick character
does not gain back any lost Hit Points by resting before the illness runs
its course. Naturally, it needn't be this way, and a full-blown disease
system could well be a fun addition, but like I've said before and will say
again, one of the greatest strengths of Xenocide is its use of relatively
simple and easy-to-understand systems, which means better approachability.

So, how about a more generic, but still detailed, system where a disease
attacks a random stat, lowering it by one every so many turns, until the
player gets better (after a random number of turns). Oh, and resting also does
not heal any HP - but might count as multiple turns towards defeating the
disease.

> *** CROUCHING / STANCES ***
>
This would certainly add to the tactical options available, and I do miss the
ability to crawl in some other tactical simulation games, but... I don't think
they'll add that much to Xenocide, which after all, is at least as much about
exploration as it is about combat. (Also, I can see myself forgetting to stand
up after crouching, and laboriously duck-waddling around an entire level...
^_^) I think it's only fair to assume that the player automatically ducks and
braces his weapon when engaging in a firefight...

Wait... DOOM the RL? I didn't even know one existed. (That's what you get
for not following the newsgroups.) Thanks for the tip! And the developer...
one Kornel Kisielewicz. What IS it with you Poles?! Determined to flood the
market with quality Roguelikes?

Now, playing DoomRL, it occurred to me that we should have a BFG-like weapon
in Xenocide. You know, a ridiculously powerful weapon whose usefulness is
limited only by a delay _before_ it goes off (because it uses a highly
volatile form of energy that must be released just as soon as its capacitors
are fully charged, yadda yadda ya). I had the silly idea of a gun that, when
fired, gives the message at one-turn intervals: "3..." then "2..." then "1..."
and only then is the blast released. Of course, in order for this to be an
actual limitation, the target should either be selected when the firing
command is issued, OR perhaps the blast fires in the direction toward which
the player last moved. Thoughts?

(Oh yeah, Steve, you suggested the addition of the BFG to Xenocide a while
back, possibly under the name "Hellstorm 9000". It's a great name - a subtle
reference to the subject matter of DOOM. Perhaps we could describe it as a
"blast field gun" - that's what BFG stands for, right? Right? ^_^;)

This is a highly sensible way to handle shooting. However, I want to bring up
the question: if you target a spot on the floor, what will happen? Presumably,
the shot will be targetted at that spot, and will hit the floor, somewhere
around that spot. The reason I wanted to ask is best explained with an
anecdote. Once upon a time, there was a marvellous game called Laser Squad on
the extinct ZX Spectrum system (it was also available for the Commodore 64,
which had superior sound but poorer graphics). This game remains today a
perfectly good reason to keep a Spectrum (or C-64) emulator around on your
hard drive - just don't touch the identical PC or Amiga versions, they stink.
(It was also the basis for a much later, and much better-known, game - UFO:
Enemy Unknown, released as X-COM: UFO Defense in the US.) But I digress. Laser
Squad handled shooting exactly like Jakub explained - with one crucial
difference: shots never hit the floor. A friend of mine discovered that by
manoeuvring your man so that he directly faced the enemy, then tapping the
joystick ever so slightly so that the crosshair barely moved forwards, and
aiming the fire at that spot, the distance between the start and end points
was so small that the angle variation really didn't do anything, so all shots,
no matter how inaccurate, would then be fired unerringly forward to strike the
target. Now... we don't want this to happen in Xenocide... do we? ^_^

Well, folks, that's all from me for now (believe it or not)! Now I'll sit
back and wait for your replies... which will probably take forever... Serves
me right. Over to you.

Great. On Saturday I have finally last exams in the morning, and all
the weekend I plan to spend on Xenocide.
The first thing to modify will be the skill system.

It's pretty easy. Particles have desired angle, which is calculated
from place of start end place of end. Then the angle is modified.
This modification depends f.e. on skill and on weapon accuracy.
It's like a shooting in real world. You want to hit something, but
your hands are shaking.
Next, bullet goes with the calculated angle, so the further it is,
miss distance is higher.

A good idea.
It has to wait a bit for implementation. I still keep in mind all the
discussion that were recently, and were there many interesting ideas
worth to implement. First - skill system. Next - new monsters. Then -
weapons.

Nah, It would require too many changes...

Hello everyone at Xenocide Development.

I thought I'd try and stir up some discussion by injecting some thoughts 
concerning some of Marek's ideas, mostly in regards to the frag grenades.

I was thinking about how particles (such as bullets) are traced in Xenocide. 
It might be interesting to see if a basic particle implementation system could 
be developed, one that could be used to plot both the course of bullets and 
the course of grenade shrapnel. This would mean that the shrapnel shards would 
function much like weak bullets, being fired outward in a variety of 
semi-random directions.

These shards would be fired off simultaneously, each with its own semi-random 
path and power to be plotted. I think that simply extending the regular 
bullet system to cover weapons of this sort could make things a lot easier on us 
all.

Such a system could also be extended to further develop the effects of 
shotguns. I know right now that shotgun fire works as ordinary rifles. What if such 
a particle system was used to make regular shotgun shells fire a cluster of 
tiny particles, some which would remain in the line of fire, others which would 
drift toward the side. Using such a system, shot fired from a shotgun could 
harm multiple enemies at once, making the weapon even more useful (especially 
since the shells are so dang heavy to carry).

This system seems to work great in DooM the Roguelike. 'Tis a really, really 
fun game. Brings back such pleasant memories :)

Ideally, the number of particles being fired from a shotgun would depend on 
the shells being used, and the spread would depend on the shells and the gun. 
Also, a double barrelled shot gun could, instead of firing twice in a row, 
could simply fire two shells at once, with twice the number of particles being 
fired.

Also, on the matter of a global speed system, what about a quasi real-time 
system similar to that found in Gearhead, where every action takes up a certain 
amount of 'time' represented in seconds, minutes and hours (and maybe even 
days). That way, automatic weapon fire would not increase with speed, because it 
would have its own values that allow the game to calculate how long each shot 
takes. The only bearing the player would have on gun fire time would be how 
quickly it takes for him to pull the trigger.

Well, that's all from me, for now. Trying to keep such messages short.

God Bless,

-Steve

It will come for sure (sooner or later) :)
Probably in next too weeks I'll pass all my exams and will have much

Moreover - my brother found Xeno very exciting and gives me cool
feedback, that is very motivating.

Well, hello everyone out there at Xenocide development. I thought I would 
just write to wish you all a happy new year!

Well, 2005 is upon us, and who knows what the new year will bring. Maybe a 
new version of Xenocide? :)

Or perhaps world-wide nuclear war :(

Ah, that thought inspires me to compose...

Those titan halls, all their treasures,
have gone away, gold turned to bone,
crowns to skulls, femurs from sceptres,
and a skeleton abides the throne.
A royal crypt, in all its splendour,
a corpse-encrusted, unhallowed sepulchre.

Yes, such a happy new year!

But my writing of this message serves another purpose than just to annoy you 
with that silly rot that I call poetry (and that everyone else calls lunacy). 
I'm also writing to ask Marek if he got my reply to his last message, found 
here:

http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/XenocideDevelopment/message/80

I only ask because it has been a month since I sent that message, and because 
certain other members of this list have not been getting some of my messages 
(Antti's spam blocking software kept eating them :)

Not to nag or anything. You could always just be too busy with life to reply 
:)

But that's not a chance I'm willing to take.

Anyway, I hope everyone out there has a nice last few days of January, and a 
terrific rest of the year.

God Bless,

-Steve

I was going to wait for Antti to respond, but he seems to be continuing his 
silent streak :)

Oh well. I'll just throw in my reply to Marek's last message, which I've been 
working on for the past couple of days, along with some other thoughts. Here 
it is...

>Perhaps, but please don't reduce power too much. I want it to be evil.

Well, it would be possible to have one frag grenade with a limited power 
range and few shrapnel shards, and then have another one with higher range and 
more shards, etc.

>It all depends on what effective range we want to have. BFG 9000 in

>per trace. And you get the impression that it harms everything on the

You've taken away the mystery of the BFG, and in doing so you have robbed me 
of what little joy remained in my life :)

>I mean it needs testing. Other problems that may arise are: how many
>shrapnels can hit you if you're very close ? Should we cap it at 1 ?

Capping it doesn't sound like a good idea to me, though it might be a good 
idea, depending on how high said damage is. If the damage for said fragments is 
low, then we can have lots of them (16-32?) and let the player get hit by as 
many as possible. If the damage is outrageously high, capping might not be a 
bad idea.

Keep in mind that we can have many different frag grenades, some with more 
fragments, some with less (but more powerful ones).

>(The idea is: it's very loud, for example lots of machines are
>functioning and you may not hear enemies comming, or even dinstant
>shots. You could still hear them, but you'd have to be closer).

This makes quite a bit of sense. I like it.

>NOTE: with constant sounds, there's no need to spam players with
>messages each turn. One message when entering the level, one message
>when all the machines are started, one when they are stopped.

Yes, a good idea. On a similar note, if the player hears gun fire off screen, 
he could just get the single message "You hear gunfire". If there's quite a 
bit of gunfire going on off screen, then the message could perhaps read 
"Multiple gunshots echo in your ears".

If there's a lot of battle sounds, explosions, gunshots and the like, then 
the message "The sounds of battle tear through the air" (or something like that) 
could be displayed.

>My idea is aimed at spreading paranoia. So I vote for "everything you
>see can still be heard". A bit unrealistic, but again, paranoia...

Ah. I see now. So the player would start to wonder; 'Why haven't I heard 
anything for a while? Is the Silencer around?'

>True and fun from common sense point of view, but do items on the
>ground actually count as ACTIVATED

Well, I think they do, but without battery power, they might not attract 
anything :(

>Obviously, it
>is possible to make unarmed fighting feel like yet another melee
>weapon, but why ?

I see now. Instead if making unarmed combat just like melee, we'll make it 
less direct and more tactical / versatile.

><Jakub>
>The other idea by Marek was a lowered accuarcy for player, when hit.
>Very good idea, to prevent player with ranged weapon to use it in

This is a good idea, and it give me an idea for a weapon attachment. What if 
standard rifles can be outfitted with futuristic bayonets that make them 
decent melee weapons in addition to being good ranged weapons? This way the player 
wouldn't have to worry about carrying around a melee weapon if he doesn't want 
to. Of course, most normal melee weapons would be stronger than the bayonet, 
but heavier as well.

>> Did you mean "shouldn't"?
>
>yes.

I hope I didn't sound like I was nagging about your grammar, I was just 
confused for a second there. Just making sure I was reading the sentence correctly 
:)

>Well, yes, but there are some other things to consider like being
>merciful to logs. I mean shorter messages may be more readable and
>easier to navigate through.

Speaking of message logs, instead of:

   Several items are lying here...
   Several items are lying here...
   Several items are lying here...

How about displaying it as:

   Several items are lying here... [x3]

That would shorten logs considerably.

>That would be imitating ADOM with its (almost)pointless commands like
>Wipe face or clean Ears. Pressing '5' while not under attack would be
>enough, basically the same.

True, true. Xenocide already has a relatively small number of key commands, 
and allows the player to do quite a bit, so we probably should keep things 
simple.

Halon would fit in best in the robotic factory level, methinks.

>It could, but then it can go too far.
...snip...
>Let's keep it
>simple.

Well, any benefits should (in my mind) be slight, and they should be hidden 
from the player, so he doesn't have to bother with them. They'd just boost his 
rate of success in apply a skill.

True. I just think that it is best to have some division in melee weapon 
skill, even if its as simple as "Light / Medium / Heavy" or "Swinging / Thrusting 
/ Bashing" or "Crushing / Slashing / Stabbing". "Energy", "Improvised" and/or 
"Special" could always be thrown in there as well. I just like the idea of 
having some skill division.

>Agreed, as long as they're more useful than Bridge Building (ADOM)

"Yay! I saved the carpenter! Now surely he will build me a house where I can 
keep all my loot and er... huh... what's that? A _Manual of Bridge Building_ 
and a hatchet, eh? Oh. AND some *cursed* oil of rust removal. Whoopty do..."

Lousy carpenters :)

Ah, instead of walls we have holes in the ground? Interesting. Oh, could you 
push enemies into vats of acid using 'martial arts'? Another way to get over 
such pits could be hover jackets, super jumping-boots, rocket packs...

On a similar subject, about a system of 'low walls', ones that the player can 
see over and fire over but not walk over? He could, however, climb over them, 
as well as duck behind them for cover. When climbing up onto them, he could 
also run along them, but this would make him much easier to be hit by his 
enemies.

Let's not forget grated walls / link fences that bullets can be fired through 
but cannot be crossed. Of course, you could blow such walls up, or hack them 
to bits in melee.

Well, I had a fairly easy time in the Lab the last time I played. I made sure 
to use the plastic doors to my advantage and conserve my ammo. Also, I was a 
medic, so I had every pill identified automatically, which helped a good deal.

I beat Herr Doktor, cleaned out the lab, almost dying several times but 
managing to come out on top. My best game yet.

Now I'm stuck on a level in the mines. Whenever I try to go up or down the 
'stairs' the game crashes :(

Well, my thought was that while Earth weapons should be more directly 
offensive and conventionally, Alien weapons should be more tactical and energy 
dependent. Personally, I'm quite fond of strange guns in games, and I would *really* 
like to see the Chaos Rifle implemented (though maybe as an artefact).

Now I really like this idea. A slow ball of energy that obliterates most 
forms of life (and robots). But could the enemy shoot the ball with his own energy 
rifle to cause it to explode?

Anyway, now that all that's out of the way, I have a few ideas to share. Some 
of these I'm not too fond of myself, but they seem... interesting. Anyway...

*** AIMING ***

The idea would be that the player could hit a key, such as 'a' or 'x' to take 
a moment to aim his gun. This would use up a turn, but it would also make his 
next shot more accurate. He might have to aim again after each shot, or 
perhaps only after he has moved from where he was standing when he aimed before. 
This, IMHO, would add another tactical depth to the game. "I'm low on life. Do I 
take the time to aim, or just open fire?" That kind of thing. Also, the 
farther away a target is, the more necessary aiming should be. This skill would be 
necessary for using the sniper rifle over long distances. How well you aim 
would probably be effected by a skill.

*** SHIELDS ***

When I say shields, I am referring to the futuristic descendants of modern 
riot shields. The idea is that the shield has a chance to block enemy attacks, 
much like the old armour system did. If the shield is hit, then the shield 
absorbs the damage instead of the player.

Obviously smaller shields would block less of the time (20-30%), but would 
last longer. Larger shields would block more of the time (up to 90%), and have 
higher HP, but would break somewhat quickly because they would be absorbing so 
much damage. Of course, certain shields would last longer than others, e.g. 
plastic is weaker than metal, but lighter and more common.

There is also a good chance that armour piercing rounds could tear through 
the shield, doing damage to both the shield and the player. Stronger shields are 
more immune to this effect. If a shield does catch an armour piercing round, 
the round does double damage to the shield, as does any AP melee weapon.

Also, energy weapons tend to wreck weaker shields, especially heat 
(electricity and radiation tend to pass right through them, except for the most powerful 
of blasts). Certain shields, however, are resistant to different kinds of 
energy.

Now, there would be several draw backs to using shields. For one, most large 
metal shields are quite heavy. For another it takes skill to learn to fight 
with shields. Also, I think it would make sense that if the player is using a 
shield, then he can't switch weapons instantly, because his hands are kind of 
full (though that might be a bit extreme of a penalty). Also, certain large guns 
(minigun, flamethrower) and melee weapons (large hammer, mining drill) can't 
be used with shields (ala two handed weapons in other roguelikes), and firing 
a gun while using a shield would result in an accuracy penalty. So you really 
sacrifice some offence and speed for defence.

Now, I figured there could be four grades of shields:

Riot Shields - Made of light, clear plastic and intended primarily to block 
pistol fire and melee attacks. These shields are relatively weak, and armour 
piercing bullets tear right through them. Though they are the lightest, most 
common shields, they are only effective against weak enemies and small arms. 
Useless against energy weapons, and melts easily under heat.

Security Shields - Made of heavier, opaque plastic fortified with light metal 
supports and designed to block rifle fire, the security shield is much 
improved over the riot shield. It can take more damage before breaking, and it can 
also withstand quite a bit of heat. It occasionally catches AP rounds.

Blast Shields - Fashioned from a light, nonconductive metal alloy, these 
shields are heavier than the security shields, but also much stronger. Not only 
can they take quite a beating, but they can also block a good deal of armour 
piercing rounds (though not all - maybe only the weaker ones). In addition to 
this, it can withstand quite a bit of heat, it stops all but the strongest 
electricity, and it can even block some radiation.

Combat Shields - Wrought of a heavy, futuristic metal alloy, this is the 
ultimate shield. It is also ultimately heavy. Capable of blocking most weapon 
fire, including armour piercing rounds and energy. The biggest problem with these 
rare shields is their weight. Not for weaker characters.

In addition, certain combat shields are 'power shields' that can be activated 
like weapons and armour. Some power shields become stronger when activated, 
others absorb energy from enemy weapons and use it to recharge the player's 
batteries, while others still bounce bullets back at the enemy. Some shields can 
even repair themselves, perhaps.

Now, shields would come in four sizes: Small (30% block chance), Medium (50% 
block chance), Large (70% block chance) and Tower (90% block chance).

Anyway, that's the idea.

(NOTE: A rifle does take two hands to use. This would seem to make shields 
almost useless. I think I have a solution to this problem, however. I remember 
learning once about shields used in medieval jousting tournaments. Even though 
the lance took two hands to hold, knights were still able to wield both shield 
and spear. This is because the shields had notches in them that would hold 
the lances in place. I think such a system could be used for rifles, especially 
in the future where technology is so much more advanced. Hence the player 
would hold the rifle in his right hand, press it to his shoulder, and use the 
notch in his shield to support the weapon before, during, and after firing.)

*** DUAL WIELDING ***

I'm not very fond of this idea, but I thought I'd throw it into the mix. 
Should the player be able to hold one of the same weapon in each hand? Of course 
he would suffer an accuracy penalty, and use up twice as much ammo, but still, 
it could have its uses.

*** MORE GRENADES, ETC ***

I had a few more ideas for grenades, as well as mines and other devices and 
items. Here they are...

Radio Grenade: A kind of 'dirty-bomb' grenade that causes radiation poisoning 
to all in its radius.

Needle Grenade: A grenade that explodes in a tight radius, sending out a 
barrage of armour piercing needles.

Poison Needle Grenade: The ultimate assassin's weapon? Maybe.

Warp Grenade: A grenade whose large light-blue explosion takes several turns 
to gradually travel outward, stays that way for a few turns, and then shrinks 
again, killing most everything in its radius, maybe even walls. High tech 
stuff.

Gravity Grenade: This grenade generates a temporary field of anti gravity, 
causing enemies to float up into the air drift around aimlessly until they crash 
back down to the ground a turn or two later.

Cloaking Mine: A proximity mine that camouflages itself, so that enemies 
cannot see it to avoid it. It might be a good idea to remember where you put it, 
though, since you can't see it, either.

Flash Freezer: A grenade that, rather than freezing enemies, flash freezes 
the ground, reducing traction and turning water into slippery bridges. If used 
underwater, it creates a temporary ice wall.

Device Disruptor: This crude device temporarily scrambles all computer 
systems and electronic devices near the player. Robots go haywire, cloaking devices 
flicker, mines explode at random. Does not effect stronger devices or computer 
systems.

Holosuit: This device allows the player to take on the appearance of another 
creature. Will fool most intelligent creatures that navigate primarily by 
sight, but things that smell or use infra-vision will see through it.

Combat Pill: Often given to space marines and other forces, the combat pill 
drops the player into a combat rage, where all stats are temporarily increased. 
The only problem with this is that the player suffers a temporary reduction 
to all stats once the pill wears off. He may also be stunned, get sick, be 
slowed, or pass out (I know not all of that is implemented yet...). Kind of like 
the berserk potion from Crawl, only a bit more extreme.

*** MORE GUNS ***

Just a few more weapon ideas. Namely...

THE 'EVERY OTHER TURN' GUN: This alien gun fires one shot per turn, but the 
player must wait one turn before firing another shot (the gun must recharge). 
This would, of course, require planning ahead a bit to be useful.

THE SHOCKWAVE GUN: This alien gun, rather than doing great deals of damage to 
an enemy, hits him with a large, blunt shockwave designed to send enemies 
flying away from the player.

ASSAULT SHOTGUN: An automatic shot gun! Not an alien weapon, but a heavy 
Earth weapon. A good way to waste ammo, and cut through waves of enemies.

*** DISEASES ***

In addition to poisons, what if there were diseases? These wouldn't simply do 
damage over long periods of time. Rather, they would reduce the player's 
stats (usually by a few points), and his abilities to do certain things. If left 
untreated, the effects of such diseases will worsen.

Allow me to give some examples...

COMMON COLD: A simple disease that causes no damage, but that messes up the 
player's dexterity and intelligence (grogginess and sinus headaches). The 
player's ears might become clogged with wax, making it hard for him to hear. He 
will also occasionally sneeze at random, which can not only reveal his position 
while trying to hide, but can really throw off his aim if he sneezes while 
trying to shoot. Cannot be cured, the player must wait it out (it doesn't last 
that long, and it can be treated).

RATROT: Ratrot is a disease occasionally communicated by Claw Rats and other 
vermin. In general it causes small amounts of damage over long periods of 
time. It also greatly slows the healing time for damage, and slowly lowers the 
player's maximum HP (temporarily).

TANTALUS VIRUS: A simple stomach bug that will occasionally damage the player 
or stun him a bit due to pain. The player also stands a chance of vomiting 
(even though he never eats). Also, it is hard to ingest pills, because you keep 
puking them back up. Lasts about one 'day'.

SCARLET RASH: A skin rash that causes the player to itch, which messes with 
his accuracy and occasionally causes bleeding (bleeding should be a condition, 
IMHO). Sometimes the player will be forced to waste a turn scratching his rash 
(self control can help with this). It lasts for quite a bit, but is easily 
cured.

PALE GHOST DISEASE: A relatively weak disease named for the fact that it 
drains the colour from the player's face and makes him physically frail. At first 
he only looses his endurance, and a little HP. As the disease progresses he 
begins to get weaker. His strengths beings to lower a bit, as well as his 
dexterity (but only a point or two). His hands begin to shake, making aiming and 
using certain skills more difficult. He will also heal slower (this might go for 
all diseases), and move slower. The stat reductions aren't too bad, and this 
disease doesn't last all that long (a few 'days').

SOLAR FEVER: A virus that causes a horrible fever that slightly lowers the 
player's strength, dexterity, endurance, and HP. It also can make the player 
dizzy, causing him to stagger ala ADoM. If left untreated, these effects worsen, 
intelligence is lowered (hard to concentrate), and the player will sometimes 
suffer some damage, and occasionally pass out.

LUNAR MADNESS: A virus that effects only the player's mind. In the early 
stages it lowers the player's intelligence, and makes using mental techniques 
difficult. In later stages he player will get headaches, which can stun him. He 
may go blind, have a harder time aiming, pass out, stagger, or "see spots" 
(where parts of his vision are obscured by random blue or rainbow # signs that 
appear on the screen).

THE YELLOW DEATH: The ultimate virus, or one of them, anyway. It basically 
begins to slowly lower all max stats, and I mean ALL, including speed and HP, 
until the player is dead. It doesn't go away on its own, and must be cured.

That's some, not all, of my ideas for possible diseases. Now for the 
mechanics (sort of)...

CONTRACTING DISEASES: Diseases can be contracted in a variety of ways. One, 
enemies can give the disease to the player. Two, certain pills can contain 
these diseases, and unsterilized syringes can also give the player these 
sicknesses. Three, maybe certain environments (filthy water) could infect the player.

RESISTING: The player, once he has already had a disease, stands a good 
chance to avoid getting it again. Stronger diseases are hard, if not impossible, to 
get more than once or twice. Weaker ones, which mutate rapidly, can be caught 
repeatedly. Players

DURATION: Weaker diseases tend to go away after a while, moderate diseases 
will go away but, if left untreated, might kill the player, while powerful 
diseases don't really go away with time, and must be cured.

TREATING: There are a variety of ways to treat diseases...

Treatments: Antibiotics, ointments, and other medicines can reduce the effect 
of diseases, if not curing them altogether. Can often prevent the player from 
dying, if not curing him altogether.

Cures: Nanites, medicines derived from the diseases themselves, and devices 
such as the genetic machine can all cure most weak-moderate diseases.

Vaccines: If the player has a disease, or has a pill with said disease in it, 
he can take a sample to make a vaccine. Even if he already has said disease, 
he can use the vaccine to make sure he never gets it again (except for the 
cold, which mutates too rapidly to be vaccinated).

Well, that's the (overly long) disease system idea.

Now onto...

*** CROUCHING / STANCES ***

I was wondering, what if the player had the ability to crouch? While 
crouching, the player could take cover behind low walls, he would be harder to hit 
from afar, shields would stand a better chance of protecting him, and he could 
enter special "air ducts".

The disadvantages of crouching would be that the player moves much slower, he 
would be horrible at melee combat (no dodging, no kicking, if kicking is 
implemented), and he would have to use a turn standing up.

So crouching would make the player harder to hit from afar, but it would make 
him move slower and be easier to kill in melee.

I really like this idea. It's good, IMHO.

Also, what about tactical combat stances, ala ADoM? The player could be 
either normal, defensive, or aggressive? This idea is alright, IMHO, but it doesn't 
seem imperative to me.

*** ROBOTS ***

Now, I have some ideas for robot enemies for the robot factory. Please bear 
with me...

SECURITY DRONE: The basic security bot on tank-treads, its basic function is 
to gun down the player using light firearms. It can also activate an alarm to 
summon other bots to its position.

BATTLE DRONE: A heavier security bot, driven by treads and capable of firing 
heavier weapons, such as miniguns and rocket launchers.

ARMOUR DRONE: A slow moving, heavily armoured bot. This actor has two forms, 
its battle form and its travel form. In travel form, this creature rolls up 
into an almost invulnerable ball, ala an armadillo, which rolls about, 
travelling quite quickly. In this form it can bump into the player to cause him some 
damage. In battle form it unrolls, and, though it moves much slower, it can now 
attack the player with its two light weapons (probably rifles) as well as one 
strong gun (rocket launcher or energy weapon, most likely).

ASSASSIN DRONE: A robot that is modelled after an Earth wasp of some sort, 
this enemy can use six light guns (probably pistols or machine-pistols), though 
this is not its greatest strength. Its greatest strength is its armour 
piercing "stinger", which is in reality a high-powered vibro-blade. This creature 
hovers above the ground, and though it normally moves slowly, it can speed up and 
rush the player (using up energy) in an attempt to sting him. If not trying 
to sting the player, it will keep its distance and try to kill him from afar. 

CRAWLER DRONE: Small robots kind of like the alien from "alien", these things 
can follow the player into air ducts that normally only very weak bots could 
enter. It can wield one small firearm (pistol or machine pistol) and can move 
quite fast. Also can use its vibro-knife left hand and its deadly tail in 
melee to inject a nerve toxin into the player, slowing him down, reducing his 
accuracy and making him "see spots" (ala the aforementioned disease). It is better 
in melee than from afar, and since the player has a hard time fighting in 
melee while crouching in air ducts, this robot can be quite deadly.

DEMOLITION DRONE: This drone is armed with a flamethrower and sting missile 
launchers, as well as a large rocket launcher and several grenade rifles (HE 
grenades and immolation grenades?). It is primarily concerned with reducing the 
player to a crisp. Big on offence, weak on defence, this bot is relatively 
easy to kill, but it goes out with a large bang.

REPAIR BOT: This robot repairs other robots, and can revive some fallen bots 
whose CPUs are intact. That's all. Really.

SOLDIER BOT: A humanoid robot capable of using weapons and items just like a 
human.

COMMANDO BOT: A stronger, larger version of the soldier bot that can carry 
larger loads and use weapons more efficiently. Oh, and it can also dual-wield 
heavy weapons, i.e. two miniguns, two rocket launchers, etc. Quite harder to 
kill, but rarer than the soldier.

BIOBORG: A robotic skeleton inset with organic matter designed to emulate 
human flesh, this creature is virtually indistinguishable from humans. It is also 
stronger, faster and more accurate than the commando bot (though no dual 
wielding, and not as heavily armoured), but also much rarer. Could also be called 
'A.R.N.O.L.D.' (Anthropoid Robotic Nullificator: Organic Life Destroyer).

FORCE CONTROLLER: A robot capable of manipulating energy fields, this 
powerful droid can create force fields at will. It can also rest weapons from the 
players hands, as well as send players flying backwards. It can also create 
"tractor beams" to draw the player toward itself. It will sometimes use force 
fields to ensnare the player, keeping him from running away, as well as keeping the 
player from attacking. It has a finite energy core which recharges over time. 
A good way to kill it is to hold out until its core is empty, and then hit it 
with everything you've got.

METAMORPHITE: A "unique" robot, one of the prototype models developed by the 
factory, it cannot be harmed by normal weapons, only slowed down. It must be 
melted (or possibly electrocuted) to be destroyed. This bot is, in fact, made 
up of millions of nanites, that can take any form. This droid can use all 
manner of weapons, as well as shape its own hands and limbs into deadly blades, 
hammers, axes, and other simple weapons. It can also travel back in time to... 
uh, er.. scratch that last thought...

CHAMELEON: This unique robot is the ultimate stealth model. Not only is it 
invisible to eye (cloaking device), ear (silent moving and weapons), radar 
(sound absorbing, disrupting), infravision (heat insulated, regulates its inner 
temperature to match temp of environment), but it also moves quite fast and it 
quite powerful. In order for the player to kill it, he must literally guess its 
location.

Well, that's all from me, for now.

I hope everyone out there has a merry Christmas.

God Bless,

   -Steve

<FONT FACE=arial,helvetica><HTML><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="FIXED" FACE="Courier New" LANG="0">I was going to wait for Antti to respond, but he seems to be continuing his silent streak :)<BR>
<BR>
Oh well. I'll just throw in my reply to Marek's last message, which I've been working on for the past couple of days, along with some other thoughts. Here it is...<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Perhaps, but please don't reduce power too much. I want it to be evil.<BR>
<BR>
Well, it would be possible to have one frag grenade with a limited power range and few shrapnel shards, and then have another one with higher range and more shards, etc.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;It all depends on what effective range we want to have. BFG 9000 in<BR>
&gt;classic DooM shoots 40 invisible shrapnels in a cone, 16-128 damage<BR>
&gt;per trace. And you get the impression that it harms everything on the<BR>
&gt;screen, because there are so much traces. Farther monsters are hit by<BR>
&gt;fewer "shrapnels" and take less damage.<BR>
<BR>
You've taken away the mystery of the BFG, and in doing so you have robbed me of what little joy remained in my life :)<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I mean it needs testing. Other problems that may arise are: how many<BR>
&gt;shrapnels can hit you if you're very close ? Should we cap it at 1 ?<BR>
<BR>
Capping it doesn't sound like a good idea to me, though it might be a good idea, depending on how high said damage is. If the damage for said fragments is low, then we can have lots of them (16-32?) and let the player get hit by as many as possible. If the damage is outrageously high, capping might not be a bad idea.<BR>
<BR>
Keep in mind that we can have many different frag grenades, some with more fragments, some with less (but more powerful ones).<BR>
<BR>
&gt;(The idea is: it's very loud, for example lots of machines are<BR>
&gt;functioning and you may not hear enemies comming, or even dinstant<BR>
&gt;shots. You could still hear them, but you'd have to be closer).<BR>
<BR>
This makes quite a bit of sense. I like it.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;NOTE: with constant sounds, there's no need to spam players with<BR>
&gt;messages each turn. One message when entering the level, one message<BR>
&gt;when all the machines are started, one when they are stopped.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, a good idea. On a similar note, if the player hears gun fire off screen, he could just get the single message "You hear gunfire". If there's quite a bit of gunfire going on off screen, then the message could perhaps read "Multiple gunshots echo in your ears".<BR>
<BR>
If there's a lot of battle sounds, explosions, gunshots and the like, then the message "The sounds of battle tear through the air" (or something like that) could be displayed.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;My idea is aimed at spreading paranoia. So I vote for "everything you<BR>
&gt;see can still be heard". A bit unrealistic, but again, paranoia...<BR>
<BR>
Ah. I see now. So the player would start to wonder; 'Why haven't I heard anything for a while? Is the Silencer around?'<BR>
<BR>
&gt;True and fun from common sense point of view, but do items on the<BR>
&gt;ground actually count as ACTIVATED<BR>
<BR>
Well, I think they do, but without battery power, they might not attract anything :(<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Obviously, it<BR>
&gt;is possible to make unarmed fighting feel like yet another melee<BR>
&gt;weapon, but why ?<BR>
<BR>
I see now. Instead if making unarmed combat just like melee, we'll make it less direct and more tactical / versatile.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&lt;Jakub&gt;<BR>
&gt;The other idea by Marek was a lowered accuarcy for player, when hit.<BR>
&gt;Very good idea, to prevent player with ranged weapon to use it in<BR>
&gt;close combat.<BR>
&gt;&lt;/Jakub&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;More specifically, when hit in melee and accuracy penalty only for<BR>
&gt;ranged weapons. For one round. Still possible to let enemy close and<BR>
&gt;fire shotgun in his face, once.<BR>
&gt;Such "hit penalty" can be introduced to sniper rifles, too. This time<BR>
&gt;no matter if you get hit in melee or from distance. Let's make it<BR>
&gt;"elite" weapon.<BR>
<BR>
This is a good idea, and it give me an idea for a weapon attachment. What if standard rifles can be outfitted with futuristic bayonets that make them decent melee weapons in addition to being good ranged weapons? This way the player wouldn't have to worry about carrying around a melee weapon if he doesn't want to. Of course, most normal melee weapons would be stronger than the bayonet, but heavier as well.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt; Did you mean "shouldn't"?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;yes.<BR>
<BR>
I hope I didn't sound like I was nagging about your grammar, I was just confused for a second there. Just making sure I was reading the sentence correctly :)<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Well, yes, but there are some other things to consider like being<BR>
&gt;merciful to logs. I mean shorter messages may be more readable and<BR>
&gt;easier to navigate through.<BR>
<BR>
Speaking of message logs, instead of:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Several items are lying here...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Several items are lying here...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Several items are lying here...<BR>
<BR>
How about displaying it as:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Several items are lying here... [x3]<BR>
<BR>
That would shorten logs considerably.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;That would be imitating ADOM with its (almost)pointless commands like<BR>
&gt;Wipe face or clean Ears. Pressing '5' while not under attack would be<BR>
&gt;enough, basically the same.<BR>
<BR>
True, true. Xenocide already has a relatively small number of key commands, and allows the player to do quite a bit, so we probably should keep things simple.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;There can even be better extinguishers, which extinguish all life in<BR>
&gt;the room as a bonus. By releasing highly toxic gas Halon. Halon is<BR>
&gt;very gentle for electronics and machinery, so it would feel at home in<BR>
&gt;Xenocide.<BR>
<BR>
Halon would fit in best in the robotic factory level, methinks.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;It could, but then it can go too far.<BR>
...snip...<BR>
&gt;Let's keep it<BR>
&gt;simple.<BR>
<BR>
Well, any benefits should (in my mind) be slight, and they should be hidden from the player, so he doesn't have to bother with them. They'd just boost his rate of success in apply a skill.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;(3) Where do you put blowtorch ? How about stun sticks ? Is activated<BR>
&gt;Chainsaw really an edged weapon ? By swinging it madly you're likely<BR>
&gt;ot damage the chain. My point is sci-fi melee weapons are often very<BR>
&gt;wild, sometimes beyond ability to classify.<BR>
<BR>
True. I just think that it is best to have some division in melee weapon skill, even if its as simple as "Light / Medium / Heavy" or "Swinging / Thrusting / Bashing" or "Crushing / Slashing / Stabbing". "Energy", "Improvised" and/or "Special" could always be thrown in there as well. I just like the idea of having some skill division.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Agreed, as long as they're more useful than Bridge Building (ADOM)<BR>
<BR>
"Yay! I saved the carpenter! Now surely he will build me a house where I can keep all my loot and er... huh... what's that? A _Manual of Bridge Building_ and a hatchet, eh? Oh. AND some *cursed* oil of rust removal. Whoopty do..."<BR>
<BR>
Lousy carpenters :)<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I have another use: In @mails to Jakub (and back) we discussed concept<BR>
&gt;of levels where all (or most) walls are replaced with empty space/some<BR>
&gt;kind of toxin vats. He seems to like the idea. Back to climbing:<BR>
&gt;you'd <BR>
&gt;be able to climb walls. As long as you stay adjacent to a wall, you<BR>
&gt;could travel over pits/toxins/water. Just like water/pit/toxin squares<BR>
&gt;adjacent to wall were normal floor. Obviously movement and possible<BR>
&gt;actions would be limited. And, when hit, you could fall. Yet another<BR>
&gt;benefit from Self-control skill.<BR>
<BR>
Ah, instead of walls we have holes in the ground? Interesting. Oh, could you push enemies into vats of acid using 'martial arts'? Another way to get over such pits could be hover jackets, super jumping-boots, rocket packs...<BR>
<BR>
On a similar subject, about a system of 'low walls', ones that the player can see over and fire over but not walk over? He could, however, climb over them, as well as duck behind them for cover. When climbing up onto them, he could also run along them, but this would make him much easier to be hit by his enemies.<BR>
<BR>
Let's not forget grated walls / link fences that bullets can be fired through but cannot be crossed. Of course, you could blow such walls up, or hack them to bits in melee.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I felt forced to stay on same level of Genetic Lab and hunt until able<BR>
&gt;to travel deeper. Umm, higher ? And even after lots of time wasted I<BR>
&gt;had to use booster pill after meeting Snake Man. The doc was much<BR>
&gt;easier to kill in melee than SM. I brought him down to 30% (ranged),<BR>
&gt;but current healing rates are a bit depressing. I went mad and charged<BR>
&gt;with my trusted wrench.<BR>
<BR>
Well, I had a fairly easy time in the Lab the last time I played. I made sure to use the plastic doors to my advantage and conserve my ammo. Also, I was a medic, so I had every pill identified automatically, which helped a good deal.<BR>
<BR>
I beat Herr Doktor, cleaned out the lab, almost dying several times but managing to come out on top. My best game yet.<BR>
<BR>
Now I'm stuck on a level in the mines. Whenever I try to go up or down the 'stairs' the game crashes :(<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Don't feel offended, but I often feel swarmed by lists of energy<BR>
&gt;weapons. I prefer to see them in action first, then comment. They<BR>
&gt;don't seem bad, just... to many.<BR>
<BR>
Well, my thought was that while Earth weapons should be more directly offensive and conventionally, Alien weapons should be more tactical and energy dependent. Personally, I'm quite fond of strange guns in games, and I would *really* like to see the Chaos Rifle implemented (though maybe as an artefact).<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Anyway... how about a weapon which shoots huge ball of energy,<BR>
&gt;traveling at speed 25/round, basically obliterating everything in its<BR>
&gt;path ? Monsters can be smart enough to move aside, but that's why you<BR>
&gt;have corridors &gt;:-)<BR>
<BR>
Now I really like this idea. A slow ball of energy that obliterates most forms of life (and robots). But could the enemy shoot the ball with his own energy rifle to cause it to explode?<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, now that all that's out of the way, I have a few ideas to share. Some of these I'm not too fond of myself, but they seem... interesting. Anyway...<BR>
<BR>
*** AIMING ***<BR>
<BR>
The idea would be that the player could hit a key, such as 'a' or 'x' to take a moment to aim his gun. This would use up a turn, but it would also make his next shot more accurate. He might have to aim again after each shot, or perhaps only after he has moved from where he was standing when he aimed before. This, IMHO, would add another tactical depth to the game. "I'm low on life. Do I take the time to aim, or just open fire?" That kind of thing. Also, the farther away a target is, the more necessary aiming should be. This skill would be necessary for using the sniper rifle over long distances. How well you aim would probably be effected by a skill.<BR>
<BR>
*** SHIELDS ***<BR>
<BR>
When I say shields, I am referring to the futuristic descendants of modern riot shields. The idea is that the shield has a chance to block enemy attacks, much like the old armour system did. If the shield is hit, then the shield absorbs the damage instead of the player.<BR>
<BR>
Obviously smaller shields would block less of the time (20-30%), but would last longer. Larger shields would block more of the time (up to 90%), and have higher HP, but would break somewhat quickly because they would be absorbing so much damage. Of course, certain shields would last longer than others, e.g. plastic is weaker than metal, but lighter and more common.<BR>
<BR>
There is also a good chance that armour piercing rounds could tear through the shield, doing damage to both the shield and the player. Stronger shields are more immune to this effect. If a shield does catch an armour piercing round, the round does double damage to the shield, as does any AP melee weapon.<BR>
<BR>
Also, energy weapons tend to wreck weaker shields, especially heat (electricity and radiation tend to pass right through them, except for the most powerful of blasts). Certain shields, however, are resistant to different kinds of energy.<BR>
<BR>
Now, there would be several draw backs to using shields. For one, most large metal shields are quite heavy. For another it takes skill to learn to fight with shields. Also, I think it would make sense that if the player is using a shield, then he can't switch weapons instantly, because his hands are kind of full (though that might be a bit extreme of a penalty). Also, certain large guns (minigun, flamethrower) and melee weapons (large hammer, mining drill) can't be used with shields (ala two handed weapons in other roguelikes), and firing a gun while using a shield would result in an accuracy penalty. So you really sacrifice some offence and speed for defence.<BR>
<BR>
Now, I figured there could be four grades of shields:<BR>
<BR>
Riot Shields - Made of light, clear plastic and intended primarily to block pistol fire and melee attacks. These shields are relatively weak, and armour piercing bullets tear right through them. Though they are the lightest, most common shields, they are only effective against weak enemies and small arms. Useless against energy weapons, and melts easily under heat.<BR>
<BR>
Security Shields - Made of heavier, opaque plastic fortified with light metal supports and designed to block rifle fire, the security shield is much improved over the riot shield. It can take more damage before breaking, and it can also withstand quite a bit of heat. It occasionally catches AP rounds.<BR>
<BR>
Blast Shields - Fashioned from a light, nonconductive metal alloy, these shields are heavier than the security shields, but also much stronger. Not only can they take quite a beating, but they can also block a good deal of armour piercing rounds (though not all - maybe only the weaker ones). In addition to this, it can withstand quite a bit of heat, it stops all but the strongest electricity, and it can even block some radiation.<BR>
<BR>
Combat Shields - Wrought of a heavy, futuristic metal alloy, this is the ultimate shield. It is also ultimately heavy. Capable of blocking most weapon fire, including armour piercing rounds and energy. The biggest problem with these rare shields is their weight. Not for weaker characters.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, certain combat shields are 'power shields' that can be activated like weapons and armour. Some power shields become stronger when activated, others absorb energy from enemy weapons and use it to recharge the player's batteries, while others still bounce bullets back at the enemy. Some shields can even repair themselves, perhaps.<BR>
<BR>
Now, shields would come in four sizes: Small (30% block chance), Medium (50% block chance), Large (70% block chance) and Tower (90% block chance).<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, that's the idea.<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE: A rifle does take two hands to use. This would seem to make shields almost useless. I think I have a solution to this problem, however. I remember learning once about shields used in medieval jousting tournaments. Even though the lance took two hands to hold, knights were still able to wield both shield and spear. This is because the shields had notches in them that would hold the lances in place. I think such a system could be used for rifles, especially in the future where technology is so much more advanced. Hence the player would hold the rifle in his right hand, press it to his shoulder, and use the notch in his shield to support the weapon before, during, and after firing.)<BR>
<BR>
*** DUAL WIELDING ***<BR>
<BR>
I'm not very fond of this idea, but I thought I'd throw it into the mix. Should the player be able to hold one of the same weapon in each hand? Of course he would suffer an accuracy penalty, and use up twice as much ammo, but still, it could have its uses.<BR>
<BR>
*** MORE GRENADES, ETC ***<BR>
<BR>
I had a few more ideas for grenades, as well as mines and other devices and items. Here they are...<BR>
<BR>
Radio Grenade: A kind of 'dirty-bomb' grenade that causes radiation poisoning to all in its radius.<BR>
<BR>
Needle Grenade: A grenade that explodes in a tight radius, sending out a barrage of armour piercing needles.<BR>
<BR>
Poison Needle Grenade: The ultimate assassin's weapon? Maybe.<BR>
<BR>
Warp Grenade: A grenade whose large light-blue explosion takes several turns to gradually travel outward, stays that way for a few turns, and then shrinks again, killing most everything in its radius, maybe even walls. High tech stuff.<BR>
<BR>
Gravity Grenade: This grenade generates a temporary field of anti gravity, causing enemies to float up into the air drift around aimlessly until they crash back down to the ground a turn or two later.<BR>
<BR>
Cloaking Mine: A proximity mine that camouflages itself, so that enemies cannot see it to avoid it. It might be a good idea to remember where you put it, though, since you can't see it, either.<BR>
<BR>
Flash Freezer: A grenade that, rather than freezing enemies, flash freezes the ground, reducing traction and turning water into slippery bridges. If used underwater, it creates a temporary ice wall.<BR>
<BR>
Device Disruptor: This crude device temporarily scrambles all computer systems and electronic devices near the player. Robots go haywire, cloaking devices flicker, mines explode at random. Does not effect stronger devices or computer systems.<BR>
<BR>
Holosuit: This device allows the player to take on the appearance of another creature. Will fool most intelligent creatures that navigate primarily by sight, but things that smell or use infra-vision will see through it.<BR>
<BR>
Combat Pill: Often given to space marines and other forces, the combat pill drops the player into a combat rage, where all stats are temporarily increased. The only problem with this is that the player suffers a temporary reduction to all stats once the pill wears off. He may also be stunned, get sick, be slowed, or pass out (I know not all of that is implemented yet...). Kind of like the berserk potion from Crawl, only a bit more extreme.<BR>
<BR>
*** MORE GUNS ***<BR>
<BR>
Just a few more weapon ideas. Namely...<BR>
<BR>
THE 'EVERY OTHER TURN' GUN: This alien gun fires one shot per turn, but the player must wait one turn before firing another shot (the gun must recharge). This would, of course, require planning ahead a bit to be useful.<BR>
<BR>
THE SHOCKWAVE GUN: This alien gun, rather than doing great deals of damage to an enemy, hits him with a large, blunt shockwave designed to send enemies flying away from the player.<BR>
<BR>
ASSAULT SHOTGUN: An automatic shot gun! Not an alien weapon, but a heavy Earth weapon. A good way to waste ammo, and cut through waves of enemies.<BR>
<BR>
*** DISEASES ***<BR>
<BR>
In addition to poisons, what if there were diseases? These wouldn't simply do damage over long periods of time. Rather, they would reduce the player's stats (usually by a few points), and his abilities to do certain things. If left untreated, the effects of such diseases will worsen.<BR>
<BR>
Allow me to give some examples...<BR>
<BR>
COMMON COLD: A simple disease that causes no damage, but that messes up the player's dexterity and intelligence (grogginess and sinus headaches). The player's ears might become clogged with wax, making it hard for him to hear. He will also occasionally sneeze at random, which can not only reveal his position while trying to hide, but can really throw off his aim if he sneezes while trying to shoot. Cannot be cured, the player must wait it out (it doesn't last that long, and it can be treated).<BR>
<BR>
RATROT: Ratrot is a disease occasionally communicated by Claw Rats and other vermin. In general it causes small amounts of damage over long periods of time. It also greatly slows the healing time for damage, and slowly lowers the player's maximum HP (temporarily).<BR>
<BR>
TANTALUS VIRUS: A simple stomach bug that will occasionally damage the player or stun him a bit due to pain. The player also stands a chance of vomiting (even though he never eats). Also, it is hard to ingest pills, because you keep puking them back up. Lasts about one 'day'.<BR>
<BR>
SCARLET RASH: A skin rash that causes the player to itch, which messes with his accuracy and occasionally causes bleeding (bleeding should be a condition, IMHO). Sometimes the player will be forced to waste a turn scratching his rash (self control can help with this). It lasts for quite a bit, but is easily cured.<BR>
<BR>
PALE GHOST DISEASE: A relatively weak disease named for the fact that it drains the colour from the player's face and makes him physically frail. At first he only looses his endurance, and a little HP. As the disease progresses he begins to get weaker. His strengths beings to lower a bit, as well as his dexterity (but only a point or two). His hands begin to shake, making aiming and using certain skills more difficult. He will also heal slower (this might go for all diseases), and move slower. The stat reductions aren't too bad, and this disease doesn't last all that long (a few 'days').<BR>
<BR>
SOLAR FEVER: A virus that causes a horrible fever that slightly lowers the player's strength, dexterity, endurance, and HP. It also can make the player dizzy, causing him to stagger ala ADoM. If left untreated, these effects worsen, intelligence is lowered (hard to concentrate), and the player will sometimes suffer some damage, and occasionally pass out.<BR>
<BR>
LUNAR MADNESS: A virus that effects only the player's mind. In the early stages it lowers the player's intelligence, and makes using mental techniques difficult. In later stages he player will get headaches, which can stun him. He may go blind, have a harder time aiming, pass out, stagger, or "see spots" (where parts of his vision are obscured by random blue or rainbow # signs that appear on the screen).<BR>
<BR>
THE YELLOW DEATH: The ultimate virus, or one of them, anyway. It basically begins to slowly lower all max stats, and I mean ALL, including speed and HP, until the player is dead. It doesn't go away on its own, and must be cured.<BR>
<BR>
That's some, not all, of my ideas for possible diseases. Now for the mechanics (sort of)...<BR>
<BR>
CONTRACTING DISEASES: Diseases can be contracted in a variety of ways. One, enemies can give the disease to the player. Two, certain pills can contain these diseases, and unsterilized syringes can also give the player these sicknesses. Three, maybe certain environments (filthy water) could infect the player.<BR>
<BR>
RESISTING: The player, once he has already had a disease, stands a good chance to avoid getting it again. Stronger diseases are hard, if not impossible, to get more than once or twice. Weaker ones, which mutate rapidly, can be caught repeatedly. Players<BR>
<BR>
DURATION: Weaker diseases tend to go away after a while, moderate diseases will go away but, if left untreated, might kill the player, while powerful diseases don't really go away with time, and must be cured.<BR>
<BR>
TREATING: There are a variety of ways to treat diseases...<BR>
<BR>
Treatments: Antibiotics, ointments, and other medicines can reduce the effect of diseases, if not curing them altogether. Can often prevent the player from dying, if not curing him altogether.<BR>
<BR>
Cures: Nanites, medicines derived from the diseases themselves, and devices such as the genetic machine can all cure most weak-moderate diseases.<BR>
<BR>
Vaccines: If the player has a disease, or has a pill with said disease in it, he can take a sample to make a vaccine. Even if he already has said disease, he can use the vaccine to make sure he never gets it again (except for the cold, which mutates too rapidly to be vaccinated).<BR>
<BR>
Well, that's the (overly long) disease system idea.<BR>
<BR>
Now onto...<BR>
<BR>
*** CROUCHING / STANCES ***<BR>
<BR>
I was wondering, what if the player had the ability to crouch? While crouching, the player could take cover behind low walls, he would be harder to hit from afar, shields would stand a better chance of protecting him, and he could enter special "air ducts".<BR>
<BR>
The disadvantages of crouching would be that the player moves much slower, he would be horrible at melee combat (no dodging, no kicking, if kicking is implemented), and he would have to use a turn standing up.<BR>
<BR>
So crouching would make the player harder to hit from afar, but it would make him move slower and be easier to kill in melee.<BR>
<BR>
I really like this idea. It's good, IMHO.<BR>
<BR>
Also, what about tactical combat stances, ala ADoM? The player could be either normal, defensive, or aggressive? This idea is alright, IMHO, but it doesn't seem imperative to me.<BR>
<BR>
*** ROBOTS ***<BR>
<BR>
Now, I have some ideas for robot enemies for the robot factory. Please bear with me...<BR>
<BR>
SECURITY DRONE: The basic security bot on tank-treads, its basic function is to gun down the player using light firearms. It can also activate an alarm to summon other bots to its position.<BR>
<BR>
BATTLE DRONE: A heavier security bot, driven by treads and capable of firing heavier weapons, such as miniguns and rocket launchers.<BR>
<BR>
ARMOUR DRONE: A slow moving, heavily armoured bot. This actor has two forms, its battle form and its travel form. In travel form, this creature rolls up into an almost invulnerable ball, ala an armadillo, which rolls about, travelling quite quickly. In this form it can bump into the player to cause him some damage. In battle form it unrolls, and, though it moves much slower, it can now attack the player with its two light weapons (probably rifles) as well as one strong gun (rocket launcher or energy weapon, most likely).<BR>
<BR>
ASSASSIN DRONE: A robot that is modelled after an Earth wasp of some sort, this enemy can use six light guns (probably pistols or machine-pistols), though this is not its greatest strength. Its greatest strength is its armour piercing "stinger", which is in reality a high-powered vibro-blade. This creature hovers above the ground, and though it normally moves slowly, it can speed up and rush the player (using up energy) in an attempt to sting him. If not trying to sting the player, it will keep its distance and try to kill him from afar. <BR>
<BR>
CRAWLER DRONE: Small robots kind of like the alien from "alien", these things can follow the player into air ducts that normally only very weak bots could enter. It can wield one small firearm (pistol or machine pistol) and can move quite fast. Also can use its vibro-knife left hand and its deadly tail in melee to inject a nerve toxin into the player, slowing him down, reducing his accuracy and making him "see spots" (ala the aforementioned disease). It is better in melee than from afar, and since the player has a hard time fighting in melee while crouching in air ducts, this robot can be quite deadly.<BR>
<BR>
DEMOLITION DRONE: This drone is armed with a flamethrower and sting missile launchers, as well as a large rocket launcher and several grenade rifles (HE grenades and immolation grenades?). It is primarily concerned with reducing the player to a crisp. Big on offence, weak on defence, this bot is relatively easy to kill, but it goes out with a large bang.<BR>
<BR>
REPAIR BOT: This robot repairs other robots, and can revive some fallen bots whose CPUs are intact. That's all. Really.<BR>
<BR>
SOLDIER BOT: A humanoid robot capable of using weapons and items just like a human.<BR>
<BR>
COMMANDO BOT: A stronger, larger version of the soldier bot that can carry larger loads and use weapons more efficiently. Oh, and it can also dual-wield heavy weapons, i.e. two miniguns, two rocket launchers, etc. Quite harder to kill, but rarer than the soldier.<BR>
<BR>
BIOBORG: A robotic skeleton inset with organic matter designed to emulate human flesh, this creature is virtually indistinguishable from humans. It is also stronger, faster and more accurate than the commando bot (though no dual wielding, and not as heavily armoured), but also much rarer. Could also be called 'A.R.N.O.L.D.' (Anthropoid Robotic Nullificator: Organic Life Destroyer).<BR>
<BR>
FORCE CONTROLLER: A robot capable of manipulating energy fields, this powerful droid can create force fields at will. It can also rest weapons from the players hands, as well as send players flying backwards. It can also create "tractor beams" to draw the player toward itself. It will sometimes use force fields to ensnare the player, keeping him from running away, as well as keeping the player from attacking. It has a finite energy core which recharges over time. A good way to kill it is to hold out until its core is empty, and then hit it with everything you've got.<BR>
<BR>
METAMORPHITE: A "unique" robot, one of the prototype models developed by the factory, it cannot be harmed by normal weapons, only slowed down. It must be melted (or possibly electrocuted) to be destroyed. This bot is, in fact, made up of millions of nanites, that can take any form. This droid can use all manner of weapons, as well as shape its own hands and limbs into deadly blades, hammers, axes, and other simple weapons. It can also travel back in time to... uh, er.. scratch that last thought...<BR>
<BR>
CHAMELEON: This unique robot is the ultimate stealth model. Not only is it invisible to eye (cloaking device), ear (silent moving and weapons), radar (sound absorbing, disrupting), infravision (heat insulated, regulates its inner temperature to match temp of environment), but it also moves quite fast and it quite powerful. In order for the player to kill it, he must literally guess its location.<BR>
<BR>
Well, that's all from me, for now.<BR>
<BR>
I hope everyone out there has a merry Christmas.<BR>
<BR>
God Bless,<BR>

Ok, so I am too bored to wait for Antti's repply... Sorry. If I wait
more, I'll die.

Perhaps, but please don't reduce power too much. I want it to be evil.

It all depends on what effective range we want to have. BFG 9000 in
classic DooM shoots 40 invisible shrapnels in a cone, 16-128 damage
per trace. And you get the impression that it harms everything on the
screen, because there are so much traces. Farther monsters are hit by
fewer "shrapnels" and take less damage.

http://www.gamers.org/docs/FAQ/bfgfaq/ This faq is funderful.

I mean it needs testing. Other problems that may arise are: how many
shrapnels can hit you if you're very close ? Should we cap it at 1 ?
In a way damage potential of Frag Grenade is capped anyway, because
shrapnels are limited. And you may be shielded by monster, which is
standing (now screaming) between you and detonation point... so range
is potentially limited, too. All this means it's going to be fun
device to play with.

> >#2 Silence (creature ability)

<Jakub>
I've played ADOM long time ago. Was the sound system "without limits",
I mean sound was going through the the whole level?
It could be easily implemented.
</Jakub> 

Exactly. Nice to hear "easily implemented". I dare to suggest 2
improvements:
- each sound could have defined volume, (how many squares from source
it can be still heard). I guess you'd call it "GLOSNOSC" in .DEF
files, seeing how you prefer loong "NIENAWIDZACY" to "WROGI" ;-).
- there could be ambient, constant noises filling whole level. In this
case its "GLOSNOSC" would be substracted from all other, "short"
sounds. (The idea is: it's very loud, for example lots of machines are
functioning and you may not hear enemies comming, or even dinstant
shots. You could still hear them, but you'd have to be closer).
NOTE: with constant sounds, there's no need to spam players with
messages each turn. One message when entering the level, one message
when all the machines are started, one when they are stopped.

My idea is aimed at spreading paranoia. So I vote for "everything you

That's against the whole point of silencing monster. My point was
you'd never be sure. Message you mentioned would give it all away.

I thought the same, but then an idea occured to me: why not place it
in some earlier levels, too ? Players may get used to "dumb pitiful
creature", even start to ignore it, and then... killer suprise.

True and fun from common sense point of view, but do items on the

That wasn't my point. I've seen a lot of games where they make unarmed
fighting ridiculously powerful and monotonous. They think they need
to, because you can't use any fancy weapons and so on (or even develop
special "unarmed" weapons like gauntlets !)... The result is that
there's little difference between melee weapons and unarmed fighting.
And, oh the irony, melee weapons are usually more versatile ! I always
thought hands are better at manipulating items than heavy piece of
steel. I would say it's easier to disarm your opponent with bare hands
(in case where he's holding _ranged_ weapon, of course). Obviously, it
is possible to make unarmed fighting feel like yet another melee
weapon, but why ?

Errata: I think these tricks should be especially useful against
enemies holding ranged weapons, and less useful (harder to execute)
against ones with melee weapons (risky). But yes, you're right about
usefulness. Strenght boost may help.

You both seem to prefer the SS2 approach. I played it, consider one of
top SF games, and my ideas are heavily influenced by it. I was going
to suggest autopsy to work just like in SS2... then I thought "It
would be yet another damage amplifier. Let's make something fun"

I thought opposite, slime-like creatures leave lots of room for
speculation. No one could accuse you for being silly. I like the sheer
idea of skill, which gives benefits to player rather than his
character.

<Jakub>
The other idea by Marek was a lowered accuarcy for player, when hit.
Very good idea, to prevent player with ranged weapon to use it in
close combat.
</Jakub>

More specifically, when hit in melee and accuracy penalty only for
ranged weapons. For one round. Still possible to let enemy close and
fire shotgun in his face, once.
Such "hit penalty" can be introduced to sniper rifles, too. This time
no matter if you get hit in melee or from distance. Let's make it
"elite" weapon.

Well, yes, but there are some other things to consider like being
merciful to logs. I mean shorter messages may be more readable and
easier to navigate through.

That would be imitating ADOM with its (almost)pointless commands like
Wipe face or clean Ears. Pressing '5' while not under attack would be
enough, basically the same.

Speaking of extinguishers, I already mentioned some to Jakub :>.
Specifically, ones mounted on ceiling, automatically initiating shower
when athmosphere gets hot. Like in modern buildings. Water would take
care of fire and most robots.
There can even be better extinguishers, which extinguish all life in
the room as a bonus. By releasing highly toxic gas Halon. Halon is
very gentle for electronics and machinery, so it would feel at home in
Xenocide.

Exact numbers and benefits still need to be balanced, but I think

Good point.

It could, but then it can go too far. Let's say you want to repair
your jammed gun. You may benefit from skills: Repair, Weapon
Knowledge, Handguns, and up to 2 "higher" skills. Medicine may depend
on chemistry and so on. I prefer not to compicate stuff too much,
because then I never know where to stop. Actually you could even make
several "skill trees", even overlaping each other but for the sake of
simpicity... (for example apart from ranged weapon skills there can be
"single shots" "burst shooting" "full auto" skills). Let's keep it
simple.

I thought about melee weapons as skill tree, but
(1) I think it helps to be in good shape (connection with physical)
(2) If I was you I would propose the same melee skills. But there are
weapons which can deal two kinds of damage. Are knives edged or
piercing ? Is shovel edged or blunt ?  Up to you...
(3) Where do you put blowtorch ? How about stun sticks ? Is activated
Chainsaw really an edged weapon ? By swinging it madly you're likely
ot damage the chain. My point is sci-fi melee weapons are often very
wild, sometimes beyond ability to classify.

Agreed, as long as they're more useful than Bridge Building (ADOM)

player)

I have another use: In @mails to Jakub (and back) we discussed concept
of levels where all (or most) walls are replaced with empty space/some
kind of toxin vats. He seems to like the idea. Back to climbing:
you'd 
be able to climb walls. As long as you stay adjacent to a wall, you
could travel over pits/toxins/water. Just like water/pit/toxin squares
adjacent to wall were normal floor. Obviously movement and possible
actions would be limited. And, when hit, you could fall. Yet another
benefit from Self-control skill.

> Actually, I like the difficulty level the way it is. If anything,

I felt forced to stay on same level of Genetic Lab and hunt until able
to travel deeper. Umm, higher ? And even after lots of time wasted I
had to use booster pill after meeting Snake Man. The doc was much
easier to kill in melee than SM. I brought him down to 30% (ranged),
but current healing rates are a bit depressing. I went mad and charged
with my trusted wrench.

Very nice quotes on Doc. GOod job. One more, shamelessly stolen from
Quake3Arena "Doom" character:

"You're just jealous because the voices only talk to me !" 
People give me odd looks when I say this, dunno why.

Don't feel offended, but I often feel swarmed by lists of energy
weapons. I prefer to see them in action first, then comment. They
don't seem bad, just... to many.

Anyway... how about a weapon which shoots huge ball of energy,
traveling at speed 25/round, basically obliterating everything in its
path ? Monsters can be smart enough to move aside, but that's why you
have corridors >:-)
Most rockets are faster than even tank bullets.

Kill you later !

Started typing before I saw Jakub's reply, so I may have repeated some of 
what he said.

Typing mode set to speedy and sloppy, with unnecessary verbosity.

Well, power reduction with range might be a good idea, if only because it 
would be annoying to get killed by a single piece of shrapnel from across an open 
level like the city. It wouldn't happen that often, but it would still 
happen, I think.

Other than that, though, great idea. No damage radius, just several shards of 
shrapnel travelling in straight lines. But how many pieces of shrapnel would 
there be? A random number from 5-8? More or less?

Interesting idea... It would be necessary, as you mentioned, to have a sound 
system...

On this topic, I was wondering, what kind of sounds should the player be able 
to hear? Is he told he hears a grenade exploding or a gun firing only when he 
doesn't see it (i.e., the blast or the shot is off screen)? In that case, if 
the player shoots his own gun, and this 'silencing' monster is nearby, would 
he receive and additional message "Your gun makes no noise"? And, if after a 
while of walking around and not hearing anything off screen, would he get a 
message along the lines of "You notice that the area seems to be awfully quiet".

Seems like it wouldn't be too hard to implement, but it does seem like a bit 
of work.

>#3 Tlaloc (fancy creature)
>(snip)

Interesting idea. I like the fact that it would make the player try and 
refrain from using energy weapons and items. This creature would probably be most 
deadly in a later level of the game, where most players will be using at least 
one energy item. Probably the "Terraformed Halls".

Though all the player would have to do to distract it is turn on a chainsaw 
and throw it away from himself, and then run...

I like these ideas, though they would probably only be useful on roughly 
human sized opponents. I did mention a 0-100 scale system once that determines 
monster size, where humans are 50. I still think it should be implemented.

Also, I think the idea of having a martial arts system with things like 
"dragon punch", "tiger claw", and "fist of a thousand super-novas" would be an 
interesting system, though I don't know if its quite right for this genre...

Now I really like this idea, though using a pen and some paper or (if using

Well, this would only be useful if the MONSTER.DEF file was hidden so that 
the player couldn't just open it up (which is a good idea, come to think of it).

I don't think that the player should get ALL the data on the creature. Just a 
few data at a time. This would require him to go through several corpses in 
order to get all the info on a monster, which should probably be displayed when 
the player looks at the creature, though perhaps on a different screen (as in 
the player hits '[' and ']' to cycle through description screens).

Also, what if performing autopsies on creatures gave the player an advantage 
against them? Some kind of unseen stat that raises the critical hit ratio when 
fighting certain creatures? It only makes sense that one acquainted with the 
anatomy of an alien life forms would have an easier time killing them than 
those who do not.

Maybe... though these should be found later in the game, in the more strange 
places (like the Terraformed halls and the Warp Gate). To be honest, though, 
I'm not really fond of the idea.

Well, weapons should always take the same amount of time to fire because of 
the fact that their mechanical parts always function in the same way (more or 
less).

However, the rate at which the player pulls the trigger can change, so yes, 
dexterity should increase the fire rate, especially for semiautomatic weapons 
to a point.

All this would require that an actual time system be implemented, which Jakub 
has yet to do.

Well, I like the idea of forcing the player to move. "You run around 
frantically, screaming in pain" or something along those lines. Though there should be 
a sort of "roll" command that allows the player to hit the ground and roll 
about, trying to extinguish the flames. Also, a chemical fire extinguisher could 
be implemented to help the player. And he could always just jump in some 
water.

>#9 New skill system (global idea)

I get it, and I like the idea. It makes sense that someone who is very 
skilled at using rifles and heavy weapons shouldn't have such a hard time using 
pistols, even if the benefit is only minimal. Still, to master a certain skill you 
should have to spend time practicing that particular skill.

Yes. Fighting with a weapon such as a knife or axe is vastly different from 
fighting with guns, though one doesn't necessarily have to be strong to be good 
at melee combat.

Or perhaps the player doesn't get a direct advantage, but just has an easier 
time learning skills in the same category.

>Self-control is prototype skill close to pain resistance. Example of

I like this idea, though perhaps it should go under Scientific/Theoretical, 
because it is more mental than anything. Swimming would also be a useful skill 
to add.

Different tools should also go under technical, as well.

It might be easier to break the high skills into "Ranged Weapons" "Melee 
Weapons" "Athletic" "Mental" "Practical"

In my mind it might look something like this...

(Note: I like games to have lots of individual skills, which Xenocide doesn't 
currently have...)

Ranged Weapons
- handguns (pistols, nail pistols, dart pistols, revolvers, hand crossbows, 
machine pistols / submachine
  guns...)
- rifles (bullet and grenade rifles)
- heavy guns (all heavy bullet guns, miniguns, rocket launchers)
- energy weapons

Melee Weapons
- unarmed combat
- edged weapons (cutting)
- blunt weapons (bashing)
- pointed weapons (stabbing)
- thrown weapons (also how well hand grenades are thrown)

Athletic Skills
- armour
- swimming
- dodging
- climbing (for climbing out of pits that might open up under the player)

Practical Skills
- demolition
- mechanics
- alien technology (the actual use of Enemy hardware)
- first aid (perhaps extended to surgery?)
- repair

Mental Skills
- medicine
- chemistry
- programming
- alien science (understanding and programming Enemy software, i.e. Micro$oft 
Windows 3000)
- self control

Anyway, that's how I think it should go (well, something along those lines).

>Current leveling formula is
>a bit extreme, but I prefer toning down some monsters than falling
>into spiral of stupidity.

Actually, I like the difficulty level the way it is. If anything, it's TOO 
easy (not for me, but for some...)

Now, all this talk about frag grenades got me thinking about different kinds 
of weapons. I was thinking primarily about the alien weapons of the Enemy, 
so...

### WEAPONS: ALIEN ###

Seeing as how the combat class will be better at using regular guns, but the 
science class will be better with alien guns, I think that alien weaponry 
should be much weirder with many more tactical uses than just all out assault.

Here are some ideas I cooked up...

CHAIN-LIGHTNING GUN: Shoots a bolt of lightning that not only does a decent 
amount of damage to an enemy, but also damages all adjacent enemies along a 
line. So if you shot one claw rat like this...

(The one with the V above his head is getting shot)

      ########
####V##.r....#
....rrrr.r...#
#######...r..#

...then the lightning would travel from claw rat to claw rat, getting weaker 
as it goes. Though this weapon isn't that strong compared to others, it can be 
used to wear down large clusters of enemies.

ORGANIC NULLIFIER: A special Enemy weapon that destroys only organic matter. 
Great against organic enemies, but useless against robots. Should it be able 
to pass through armour?

PHANTOM GUN: Shoots pulses of electrical energy that can pass through walls. 
Uses electricity to disrupt organic nervous systems as well as electrical 
robotic systems.

CHAOS RIFLE: Prototype enemy weapon that causes random effects to anything 
shot by it. Shooting an enemy one turn might damage it, the next poison it, the 
next ignite it on fire. 70% of the time the effects are harmful, 20% of the 
time the effects are beneficial (e.g. the enemy is sped up instead of slowed 
down, the enemy is healed instead of harmed, etc.), 7% of the time really weird 
and extreme things happen (the enemy is polymorphed, the enemy turns to stone, 
the enemy is flash frozen, the enemy dies, the enemy turns into a chicken, 
etc.), and 3% of the time really bad things happen, like the enemy gaining huge 
stat boosts, gaining the ability to shoot death rays from his hands, etc. Note: 
Certain enemies cannot be instakilled.

TRI-GUN: A gun that does heat, electric, and radiation damage all at once.

ARCTIC CANNON: An enemy 'freezing ray' that turns foes to ice, freezes the 
ground making enemies slip, and freezes water allowing the player to slide on 
across it.

BLAST CANNON: A gun that essentially creates explosions (ala the grenade) 
while only using energy for fuel. It takes quite a bit of energy to use per shot, 
but if you have enough batteries, then this can be quite useful, if not at 
close range.

SAPPER RIFLE: Drains energy from enemy batteries, adding it to your own power 
source.

VACUUM BLASTER: Creates a magnetic field that forces all the air from a 
radius, causing all organic life forms to suffer from some degree of decompression. 
It really hurts when the air around them comes slamming back in, too.

Well, that's it from me for now. I'd like to type more, but I'm a bit pressed 
for time. But It is nice to finally see some discussion going on around here 
again.

God Bless,

<FONT FACE=arial,helvetica><HTML><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="FIXED" FACE="Courier New" LANG="0">Started typing before I saw Jakub's reply, so I may have repeated some of what he said.<BR>
<BR>
Typing mode set to speedy and sloppy, with unnecessary verbosity.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Details: First of all, I suggest that frag grenade should have power<BR>
&gt;equivalent to HE grenade. As the name suggest, the explosion power and<BR>
&gt;radius would be fairly unimpressive. The main danger would shrapnels<BR>
&gt;flying outwards in straight lines. (Quasi)Random angles. <BR>
&gt;Range of shrapnels should be fairly long, or even unlimited. The<BR>
&gt;trick would be that even with potentially greater range, the outcome<BR>
&gt;could be very chaoitic. Chance of being hit would obviously quickly<BR>
&gt;decrease with distance. That's why power reduction with range isn't<BR>
&gt;necessary.<BR>
&gt;Throwing frag grenades in open would always be more or less risky for<BR>
&gt;user, and that's the point.<BR>
<BR>
Well, power reduction with range might be a good idea, if only because it would be annoying to get killed by a single piece of shrapnel from across an open level like the city. It wouldn't happen that often, but it would still happen, I think.<BR>
<BR>
Other than that, though, great idea. No damage radius, just several shards of shrapnel travelling in straight lines. But how many pieces of shrapnel would there be? A random number from 5-8? More or less?<BR>
<BR>
&gt;#2 Silence (creature ability)<BR>
&gt;I know little about Cthulhu (sp?) and my horror knowledge is limited,<BR>
&gt;but I got nice idea. You were talking about monsters annoucing their<BR>
&gt;presence with sounds, much like in ADOM. But... how about a STRONG<BR>
&gt;monster, which announces its presence by... silence ? We should devise<BR>
&gt;best way to drive players paranoid. It could be made that it gradually<BR>
&gt;silences the level, more specifically - sounds emited by other<BR>
&gt;creatures, machines... Or something simpler like 70% chance to cancel<BR>
&gt;a sound. Second case may be scarrier, because player would never be sure.<BR>
&gt;WARNING: this idea is highly dependant on development of sound system.<BR>
&gt;ADOM-like would be enough.<BR>
<BR>
Interesting idea... It would be necessary, as you mentioned, to have a sound system...<BR>
<BR>
On this topic, I was wondering, what kind of sounds should the player be able to hear? Is he told he hears a grenade exploding or a gun firing only when he doesn't see it (i.e., the blast or the shot is off screen)? In that case, if the player shoots his own gun, and this 'silencing' monster is nearby, would he receive and additional message "Your gun makes no noise"? And, if after a while of walking around and not hearing anything off screen, would he get a message along the lines of "You notice that the area seems to be awfully quiet".<BR>
<BR>
Seems like it wouldn't be too hard to implement, but it does seem like a bit of work.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;#3 Tlaloc (fancy creature)<BR>
&gt;(snip)<BR>
<BR>
Interesting idea. I like the fact that it would make the player try and refrain from using energy weapons and items. This creature would probably be most deadly in a later level of the game, where most players will be using at least one energy item. Probably the "Terraformed Halls".<BR>
<BR>
Though all the player would have to do to distract it is turn on a chainsaw and throw it away from himself, and then run...<BR>
<BR>
&gt;#4 Unarmed fighting (global feature)<BR>
&gt;Instead of developing dragon punches and other brute force stuff...<BR>
<BR>
Well now, let's not underestimate the power of a man who can shatter stone with his bare hands...<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Tricks available for highly skilled unarmed fighters:<BR>
&gt;- exchange position - success depends on comparison of strenght and<BR>
&gt;weight, too<BR>
&gt;- push - similar to above, but successful attack pushes enemy one<BR>
&gt;square away... or even more in case of very light creatures.<BR>
&gt;- pull - imagine a room full of soldiers, sentryguns and other<BR>
&gt;attractions. No grenades left (or you simply want some style points).<BR>
&gt;What can you do ? Well, you can drag one of them from entrance into<BR>
&gt;small room, and beat him with crowbar !<BR>
&gt;It would work like this: first you execute this special attack, second<BR>
&gt;you choose the square you want to move to. If successful, enemy moves<BR>
&gt;to your previous position.<BR>
<BR>
I like these ideas, though they would probably only be useful on roughly human sized opponents. I did mention a 0-100 scale system once that determines monster size, where humans are 50. I still think it should be implemented.<BR>
<BR>
Also, I think the idea of having a martial arts system with things like "dragon punch", "tiger claw", and "fist of a thousand super-novas" would be an interesting system, though I don't know if its quite right for this genre...<BR>
<BR>
&gt;#5 In-game notepad (global feature)<BR>
&gt;This thing would be very useful. You could write down lines like:<BR>
&gt;"Tried triangular pill and still alive"<BR>
&gt;"Left tasty shotgun at cave entrance"<BR>
&gt;"Note to self: locking that BIG SCARY MONSTER behing the door caused<BR>
&gt;me lots of trouble. Do not open"<BR>
<BR>
Now I really like this idea, though using a pen and some paper or (if using Windows) switching to a separate program can be extremely useful.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;#6 Autopsy&amp;Random Resists (general weirdness)<BR>
&gt;Another way of making Medicine skill useful and unique would be<BR>
&gt;ability to make autopsy of dead enemy. In exchange for time spent<BR>
&gt;you'd get more or less aproximated stats of the creature. And - that's<BR>
&gt;important - it's resistances. You might say "No need for that after<BR>
several games".<BR>
<BR>
Well, this would only be useful if the MONSTER.DEF file was hidden so that the player couldn't just open it up (which is a good idea, come to think of it).<BR>
<BR>
I don't think that the player should get ALL the data on the creature. Just a few data at a time. This would require him to go through several corpses in order to get all the info on a monster, which should probably be displayed when the player looks at the creature, though perhaps on a different screen (as in the player hits '[' and ']' to cycle through description screens).<BR>
<BR>
Also, what if performing autopsies on creatures gave the player an advantage against them? Some kind of unseen stat that raises the critical hit ratio when fighting certain creatures? It only makes sense that one acquainted with the anatomy of an alien life forms would have an easier time killing them than those who do not.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;This leads me to idea of... random creature resists.<BR>
&gt;Much like pills and grenades look different every game. Obviously it<BR>
&gt;doesn't make sense for all creatures to have random resist. I suggest<BR>
&gt;more slimy/weirder ones... about 10% of all monsters would be enough.<BR>
&gt;Generated once per character, all XZNJLEWNVWENI creatures would have<BR>
&gt;same resists until end of game.<BR>
&gt;Yet another way of breaking the monotony and making each game unique.<BR>
&gt;Some rules should be respected, for example "wet" creatures should be<BR>
&gt;less likely to have fire resistance.<BR>
<BR>
Maybe... though these should be found later in the game, in the more strange places (like the Terraformed halls and the Warp Gate). To be honest, though, I'm not really fond of the idea.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;#7 Speed stat and rate of fire (global)<BR>
&gt;Don't you think it's strange booster pill makes you shoot so much<BR>
&gt;faster ? It makes sense for melee and unarmed fighting, but why<BR>
&gt;exactly for ranged weapons ? It may get very strage with weapons like<BR>
&gt;minigun, which - supposedly - fires constant hail of lead.<BR>
&gt;My suggestion is that Speed stat should quicken ranged weapons.<BR>
<BR>
Did you mean "shouldn't"?<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Ranged weapons may be quickened by Dexterity stat. My assumption is that<BR>
&gt;while Speed stat is general speed of your whole body, Dexterity is<BR>
&gt;speed/precision of your fingers. If we want to keep the game<BR>
&gt;absolutely real, there should be no way to speed up minigun, however.<BR>
<BR>
Well, weapons should always take the same amount of time to fire because of the fact that their mechanical parts always function in the same way (more or less).<BR>
<BR>
However, the rate at which the player pulls the trigger can change, so yes, dexterity should increase the fire rate, especially for semiautomatic weapons to a point.<BR>
<BR>
All this would require that an actual time system be implemented, which Jakub has yet to do.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;#8 Sadistic fire idea (global)<BR>
&gt;In reality, someone being on fire doesn't really want to stay in one<BR>
&gt;place. Running around screaming is much more popular, even if it's<BR>
&gt;worst thing to do (more oxygen, greater flame).<BR>
&gt;How about forcing the player to move when on fire ? It could be<BR>
&gt;random, and there would be 3 possible outcomes each turn:<BR>
&gt;- random move<BR>
&gt;- forced move, i.e. you have to move/attack in melee but you choose where<BR>
&gt;- character stays calm<BR>
&gt;Currently being on fire isn't very different from Bleeding in ADOM, or<BR>
&gt;being poisoned. Do you think idea mentioned above would be fun ?<BR>
<BR>
Well, I like the idea of forcing the player to move. "You run around frantically, screaming in pain" or something along those lines. Though there should be a sort of "roll" command that allows the player to hit the ground and roll about, trying to extinguish the flames. Also, a chemical fire extinguisher could be implemented to help the player. And he could always just jump in some water.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;#9 New skill system (global idea)<BR>
&gt;(snip)<BR>
<BR>
I get it, and I like the idea. It makes sense that someone who is very skilled at using rifles and heavy weapons shouldn't have such a hard time using pistols, even if the benefit is only minimal. Still, to master a certain skill you should have to spend time practicing that particular skill.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Ranged Weapons:<BR>
&gt;- handguns <BR>
&gt;- rifles<BR>
&gt;- heavy weapons (grenade launcher, minigun, flamer...)<BR>
&gt;- energy weapons<BR>
&gt;- weapon knowledge (perhaps made obsolete by higher skill "Ranged<BR>
&gt;Weapons" ? What exactly do you expect from this skill ?)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Physical skills:<BR>
&gt;- dodging<BR>
&gt;- throwing<BR>
&gt;- melee weapons<BR>
&gt;- unarmed <BR>
&gt;- stealth (hopefully going to be implemented)<BR>
&gt;- armor<BR>
&gt;- self-control<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Technical Skills<BR>
&gt;- demolition<BR>
&gt;- mechanics<BR>
&gt;- first aid (!)<BR>
&gt;- repair<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Scientific/Theoretical Skills<BR>
&gt;- medicine<BR>
&gt;- chemistry<BR>
&gt;- programming<BR>
&gt;- alien science<BR>
&gt;- ...<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Notes:<BR>
&gt;I really believe melee weapon usage and unarmed fighting have more to<BR>
&gt;do with overall body fitness than with reloading and ironsights.<BR>
<BR>
Yes. Fighting with a weapon such as a knife or axe is vastly different from fighting with guns, though one doesn't necessarily have to be strong to be good at melee combat. <BR>
<BR>
&gt;If you raise your dodging skill, higher skill "Physical skills" slowly<BR>
&gt;increases. This results in bonus to all remaining skills associated<BR>
&gt;with "Physical skills": throwing, armor, melee weapons, unarmed,<BR>
&gt;stealth...<BR>
&gt;I suggest something along the lines "1 point of high skill per 4<BR>
&gt;points of low skill". <BR>
<BR>
Or perhaps the player doesn't get a direct advantage, but just has an easier time learning skills in the same category.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Self-control is prototype skill close to pain resistance. Example of<BR>
&gt;benefits: higher chance to stay calm when on fire, lower chance to<BR>
&gt;drop grenade when hit, lower chance to gasp (drowning damage) when hit<BR>
&gt;while underwater...<BR>
<BR>
I like this idea, though perhaps it should go under Scientific/Theoretical, because it is more mental than anything. Swimming would also be a useful skill to add.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Demolition would be knowledge about material endurance and ability to<BR>
&gt;apply force efficiently. It would affect especially stationary<BR>
&gt;explosives, possibly mining, too. It could help score criticals<BR>
&gt;against robots.<BR>
<BR>
Different tools should also go under technical, as well.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Distinguishing "technical" from "scientific" skill can be tricky and<BR>
&gt;controversial. My definition is that technical skills are used to<BR>
&gt;apply knowledge in reality, especially other things. Programming goes<BR>
&gt;to scientific because it's more like brain exercise, I think. First<BR>
&gt;aid is technical because of "cut that bit here, put that there...". It<BR>
&gt;would help with recent wounds, but not much else. On the other hand,<BR>
&gt;medicine would help with more advanced ...medicines, a bit more<BR>
&gt;complex than bandages. It would help with autopsy or using Genetic<BR>
&gt;Machine.<BR>
<BR>
Medicine could give bonuses to first aid, too.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;If implemented, it would help creating pills. Increased<BR>
&gt;chance of critical hit against most organic creatures...<BR>
&gt;Chemistry, if implemented, could be used to make home-made explosives,<BR>
&gt;enhancing grenades etc making them more powerful but potentially not<BR>
&gt;safe to use.<BR>
<BR>
It might be easier to break the high skills into "Ranged Weapons" "Melee Weapons" "Athletic" "Mental" "Practical"<BR>
<BR>
In my mind it might look something like this...<BR>
<BR>
(Note: I like games to have lots of individual skills, which Xenocide doesn't currently have...)<BR>
<BR>
Ranged Weapons<BR>
- handguns (pistols, nail pistols, dart pistols, revolvers, hand crossbows, machine pistols / submachine<BR>
&nbsp; guns...)<BR>
- rifles (bullet and grenade rifles)<BR>
- heavy guns (all heavy bullet guns, miniguns, rocket launchers)<BR>
- energy weapons<BR>
<BR>
Melee Weapons<BR>
- unarmed combat<BR>
- edged weapons (cutting)<BR>
- blunt weapons (bashing)<BR>
- pointed weapons (stabbing)<BR>
- thrown weapons (also how well hand grenades are thrown)<BR>
<BR>
Athletic Skills<BR>
- armour<BR>
- swimming<BR>
- dodging<BR>
- climbing (for climbing out of pits that might open up under the player)<BR>
<BR>
Practical Skills<BR>
- demolition<BR>
- mechanics<BR>
- alien technology (the actual use of Enemy hardware)<BR>
- first aid (perhaps extended to surgery?)<BR>
- repair<BR>
<BR>
Mental Skills<BR>
- medicine<BR>
- chemistry<BR>
- programming<BR>
- alien science (understanding and programming Enemy software, i.e. Micro$oft Windows 3000)<BR>
- self control<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, that's how I think it should go (well, something along those lines).<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Current leveling formula is<BR>
&gt;a bit extreme, but I prefer toning down some monsters than falling<BR>
&gt;into spiral of stupidity.<BR>
<BR>
Actually, I like the difficulty level the way it is. If anything, it's TOO easy (not for me, but for some...)<BR>
<BR>
Now, all this talk about frag grenades got me thinking about different kinds of weapons. I was thinking primarily about the alien weapons of the Enemy, so...<BR>
<BR>
### WEAPONS: ALIEN ###<BR>
<BR>
Seeing as how the combat class will be better at using regular guns, but the science class will be better with alien guns, I think that alien weaponry should be much weirder with many more tactical uses than just all out assault.<BR>
<BR>
Here are some ideas I cooked up...<BR>
<BR>
CHAIN-LIGHTNING GUN: Shoots a bolt of lightning that not only does a decent amount of damage to an enemy, but also damages all adjacent enemies along a line. So if you shot one claw rat like this...<BR>
<BR>
(The one with the V above his head is getting shot)<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ########<BR>
####V##.r....#<BR>
....rrrr.r...#<BR>
#######...r..#<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ########<BR>
<BR>
...then the lightning would travel from claw rat to claw rat, getting weaker as it goes. Though this weapon isn't that strong compared to others, it can be used to wear down large clusters of enemies.<BR>
<BR>
ORGANIC NULLIFIER: A special Enemy weapon that destroys only organic matter. Great against organic enemies, but useless against robots. Should it be able to pass through armour?<BR>
<BR>
PHANTOM GUN: Shoots pulses of electrical energy that can pass through walls. Uses electricity to disrupt organic nervous systems as well as electrical robotic systems.<BR>
<BR>
CHAOS RIFLE: Prototype enemy weapon that causes random effects to anything shot by it. Shooting an enemy one turn might damage it, the next poison it, the next ignite it on fire. 70% of the time the effects are harmful, 20% of the time the effects are beneficial (e.g. the enemy is sped up instead of slowed down, the enemy is healed instead of harmed, etc.), 7% of the time really weird and extreme things happen (the enemy is polymorphed, the enemy turns to stone, the enemy is flash frozen, the enemy dies, the enemy turns into a chicken, etc.), and 3% of the time really bad things happen, like the enemy gaining huge stat boosts, gaining the ability to shoot death rays from his hands, etc. Note: Certain enemies cannot be instakilled.<BR>
<BR>
TRI-GUN: A gun that does heat, electric, and radiation damage all at once.<BR>
<BR>
ARCTIC CANNON: An enemy 'freezing ray' that turns foes to ice, freezes the ground making enemies slip, and freezes water allowing the player to slide on across it.<BR>
<BR>
BLAST CANNON: A gun that essentially creates explosions (ala the grenade) while only using energy for fuel. It takes quite a bit of energy to use per shot, but if you have enough batteries, then this can be quite useful, if not at close range.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
VACUUM BLASTER: Creates a magnetic field that forces all the air from a radius, causing all organic life forms to suffer from some degree of decompression. It really hurts when the air around them comes slamming back in, too.<BR>
<BR>
Well, that's it from me for now. I'd like to type more, but I'm a bit pressed for time. But It is nice to finally see some discussion going on around here again.<BR>

Hello guys :)

I'm writing in a rush, so please, forgive me my langauge mistakes.
I won't have time to check the letter :/

I'm not on my computer and "crowd" convince me to "leave that f***ing machine
for higher purposes" like watching movies or chatting... Well...

c> 2) He knows the code - some ideas would be apparently hard/impossible
c> to implement. Let him decide which ones.

I'll send the full translation... soon.

c> I'll concentrate on fresh stuff. Some ideas are still waiting for
c> right moment/refining in my notepad. I try to go for diversity, and
c> don't let myself get too carried away.

great :)

I like that idea. Written down :)

c> #2 Silence (creature ability)

c> WARNING: this idea is highly dependant on development of sound system.
c> ADOM-like would be enough.

I've played ADOM long time ago. Was the sound system "without limits",
I mean sound was going through the the whole level?
It could be easily implemented.

c> #3 Tlaloc (fancy creature)
c> [...]

I really like descriptions like this one. Tlaloc would be fun to fight
with and would require some tactics to kill him.

c> #5 In-game notepad (global feature)
c> This thing would be very useful. You could write down lines like:
c> "Tried triangular pill and still alive"
c> "Left tasty shotgun at cave entrance"
c> "Note to self: locking that BIG SCARY MONSTER behing the door caused
c> me lots of trouble. Do not open"

IMHO it's a good idea. Playing games I write things down on the paper,
usually when I have a long break in the game. It would be useful.

c> #6 Autopsy&Random Resists (general weirdness)
c> [...]
c> Yet another way of breaking the monotony and making each game unique.
c> Some rules should be respected, for example "wet" creatures should be
c> less likely to have fire resistance.

A good idea, but I've planned to implement something, what I saw in
System Shock 2 - analyze corpses.
Player character (especially medic) could take the parts of the
corpses and analyze them with some tool. Such kind of analyze would
give him bonuses when fighting with creatures.
Monsters could be split into several "classes", and such analyze would
give bonus to fight with all monsters from one class.

c> #7 Speed stat and rate of fire (global)
c> Don't you think it's strange booster pill makes you shoot so much
c> faster ? It makes sense for melee and unarmed fighting, but why
c> exactly for ranged weapons ? It may get very strage with weapons like
c> minigun, which - supposedly - fires constant hail of lead.

Good point.

c> My suggestion is that Speed stat should quicken ranged weapons. Ranged
c> weapons may be quickened by Dexterity stat. My assumption is that
c> while Speed stat is general speed of your whole body, Dexterity is
c> speed/precision of your fingers. If we want to keep the game
c> absolutely real, there should be no way to speed up minigun, however.

True. Dexterity can be used to determine time required for firing.
Moreover - delay will depend on the firing type. With burst or triple
shoot will take 50% more time than single shot.

The other idea by Marek was a lowered accuarcy for player, when hit.
Very good idea, to prevent player with ranged weapon to use it in
close combat.

c> #8 Sadistic fire idea (global)
c> [...]
c> Currently being on fire isn't very different from Bleeding in ADOM, or
c> being poisoned. Do you think idea mentioned above would be fun ?

Fun, I like it, very nasty :>
(I've told you guys that Marek has some brillant ideas) ;)

c> #9 New skill system (global idea)
c> First draft

I'm waiting for opinions from the others.

c> Opinions:
c>  I like it that characters don't double their hp with each level. It
c> helps to keep balance. It will help things like grenades stay

You're probably talking now about "deeper" levels of Mines?
They are so hard now, to stop player there ;)
Really :)
For now there's nothing below done now. I've got comments, that
it's really disappointing to see "emptiness" after hard combat
in previous version, so... player has no chances now :]
It will change of course as soon as I'll extend the game.

BTW: I plan to force player to visit several places, as in Crawl.
Player will have to change "path" and visit other regions, to get new
items/experience to survive deeper in the main path, or even in the
region where he is. There is a randomness implemented and enterances
to the other regions can be placed on random levels.
Of course player will not have to visit all the places. It will depend
on his choices and collected items (for example radioactive desert
only having protecting suit and flooded caves having something to
breath underwater).

regards,
Jakub

Hey

Thanks for warm greeting. 
I didn't translate the ideas from letter to Jakub because

1) I'm supposed to spend as little time as possible sitting (back from
hospital)

2) He knows the code - some ideas would be apparently hard/impossible
to implement. Let him decide which ones.

I'll concentrate on fresh stuff. Some ideas are still waiting for
right moment/refining in my notepad. I try to go for diversity, and
don't let myself get too carried away.

---------------------------

#1 Fragmentation grenades (item)
Everybody loves frag grenades ! There are already plenty of gas/area
grenades with long duration. This toy would break the monotony.
Details: First of all, I suggest that frag grenade should have power
equivalent to HE grenade. As the name suggest, the explosion power and
radius would be fairly unimpressive. The main danger would shrapnels
flying outwards in straight lines. (Quasi)Random angles. 
 Range of shrapnels should be fairly long, or even unlimited. The
trick would be that even with potentially greater range, the outcome
could be very chaoitic. Chance of being hit would obviously quickly
decrease with distance. That's why power reduction with range isn't
necessary.
Throwing frag grenades in open would always be more or less risky for
user, and that's the point.

#2 Silence (creature ability)
I know little about Cthulhu (sp?) and my horror knowledge is limited,
but I got nice idea. You were talking about monsters annoucing their
presence with sounds, much like in ADOM. But... how about a STRONG
monster, which announces its presence by... silence ? We should devise
best way to drive players paranoid. It could be made that it gradually
silences the level, more specifically - sounds emited by other
creatures, machines... Or something simpler like 70% chance to cancel
a sound. Second case may be scarrier, because player would never be sure.
WARNING: this idea is highly dependant on development of sound system.
ADOM-like would be enough.

#3 Tlaloc (fancy creature)
Tlaloc (work name, actually Aztec god of rain. I simply like the name)
would be nasty, slime-like creature. Fairly resistant, possibly with
slow regeneration... Not too fast - 20 or so. The creature itself is
blind and deaf. It can't see @ unless it's like 2 squares away. If hit
by grenade, it merely moves out of blast area. If shot, it goes to
approximated last position of player.
The catch is the creature is very sensitive to energy. If player uses
power-draining weapon, armor, or implants - Tlaloc gets excited. In
this mode its speed is double to 40, and it knows exact @'s position
no matter what. Power-draining attack would fit here.
Simply damaging Tlaloc would double it's speed, but nothing else.

#4 Unarmed fighting (global feature)
Instead of developing dragon punches and other brute force stuff...
Tricks available for highly skilled unarmed fighters:
- exchange position - success depends on comparison of strenght and
weight, too
- push - similar to above, but successful attack pushes enemy one
square away... or even more in case of very light creatures.
- pull - imagine a room full of soldiers, sentryguns and other
attractions. No grenades left (or you simply want some style points).
What can you do ? Well, you can drag one of them from entrance into
small room, and beat him with crowbar !
It would work like this: first you execute this special attack, second
you choose the square you want to move to. If successful, enemy moves
to your previous position.
NOTE: all this displacing tricks wouldn't work on sentryguns.
- Wrestling mode: if hit by successful wrestling attack, the opponent
would suffer from following effects in next round: a) inability to use
ranged weapons, b) lower chance to hit with melee weapons (lower
penalty for short weapons like knives).

#5 In-game notepad (global feature)
This thing would be very useful. You could write down lines like:
"Tried triangular pill and still alive"
"Left tasty shotgun at cave entrance"
"Note to self: locking that BIG SCARY MONSTER behing the door caused
me lots of trouble. Do not open"

#6 Autopsy&Random Resists (general weirdness)
Another way of making Medicine skill useful and unique would be
ability to make autopsy of dead enemy. In exchange for time spent
you'd get more or less aproximated stats of the creature. And - that's
important - it's resistances. You might say "No need for that after
several games". This leads me to idea of... random creature resists.
Much like pills and grenades look different every game. Obviously it
doesn't make sense for all creatures to have random resist. I suggest
more slimy/weirder ones... about 10% of all monsters would be enough.
Generated once per character, all XZNJLEWNVWENI creatures would have
same resists until end of game.
Yet another way of breaking the monotony and making each game unique.
Some rules should be respected, for example "wet" creatures should be
less likely to have fire resistance.

#7 Speed stat and rate of fire (global)
Don't you think it's strange booster pill makes you shoot so much
faster ? It makes sense for melee and unarmed fighting, but why
exactly for ranged weapons ? It may get very strage with weapons like
minigun, which - supposedly - fires constant hail of lead.
My suggestion is that Speed stat should quicken ranged weapons. Ranged
weapons may be quickened by Dexterity stat. My assumption is that
while Speed stat is general speed of your whole body, Dexterity is
speed/precision of your fingers. If we want to keep the game
absolutely real, there should be no way to speed up minigun, however.

#8 Sadistic fire idea (global)
In reality, someone being on fire doesn't really want to stay in one
place. Running around screaming is much more popular, even if it's
worst thing to do (more oxygen, greater flame).
How about forcing the player to move when on fire ? It could be
random, and there would be 3 possible outcomes each turn:
- random move
- forced move, i.e. you have to move/attack in melee but you choose where
- character stays calm
Currently being on fire isn't very different from Bleeding in ADOM, or
being poisoned. Do you think idea mentioned above would be fun ?

#9 New skill system (global idea)
First draft

I had a dream. There were 2 kind of skills: lower skills and higher
skills.
You can't raise higher skills directly. Lower skills can be raised by
use, and by points allocated after leveling up.
Higher skills would be like: Ranged Weapons, Physical Skills,
Technical Skills, Scientific Skills. The idea behind is: you can get
used to certain kind of activities. Being good at math exercices your
mind, logical abilities, that's why you you'd have less problem with
physics or chemistry. If you spend some time using handguns, you learn
some basics and mastering rifles isn't as hard as before. (easier to
switch favourite weapons).
Level of higher skill depends on levels of lowers skills associated
with it. At the same time, having better High skill gives bonuses to
lower skills. I'm afraid I couldn't make it more unclear. I tried hard.

Ranged Weapons:
 - handguns 
 - rifles
 - heavy weapons (grenade launcher, minigun, flamer...)
 - energy weapons
 - weapon knowledge (perhaps made obsolete by higher skill "Ranged
Weapons" ? What exactly do you expect from this skill ?)

Physical skills:
- dodging
- throwing
- melee weapons
- unarmed 
- stealth (hopefully going to be implemented)
- armor
- self-control

Technical Skills
- demolition
- mechanics
- first aid (!)
- repair

Scientific/Theoretical Skills
- medicine
- chemistry
- programming
- alien science
- ...

Notes:
I really believe melee weapon usage and unarmed fighting have more to
do with overall body fitness than with reloading and ironsights.
If you raise your dodging skill, higher skill "Physical skills" slowly
increases. This results in bonus to all remaining skills associated
with "Physical skills": throwing, armor, melee weapons, unarmed,
stealth...
I suggest something along the lines "1 point of high skill per 4
points of low skill". 
Armor skill is ability to use armor efficiently, knowledge of its
strenghts and weaknesses. Effects can be: worn armor is treated as if
it weighted less, armor disadvantages slightly reduced.
Self-control is prototype skill close to pain resistance. Example of
benefits: higher chance to stay calm when on fire, lower chance to
drop grenade when hit, lower chance to gasp (drowning damage) when hit
while underwater...
Demolition would be knowledge about material endurance and ability to
apply force efficiently. It would affect especially stationary
explosives, possibly mining, too. It could help score criticals
against robots.
Distinguishing "technical" from "scientific" skill can be tricky and
controversial. My definition is that technical skills are used to
apply knowledge in reality, especially other things. Programming goes
to scientific because it's more like brain exercise, I think. First
aid is technical because of "cut that bit here, put that there...". It
would help with recent wounds, but not much else. On the other hand,
medicine would help with more advanced ...medicines, a bit more
complex than bandages. It would help with autopsy or using Genetic
Machine. If implemented, it would help creating pills. Increased
chance of critical hit against most organic creatures...
Chemistry, if implemented, could be used to make home-made explosives,
enhancing grenades etc making them more powerful but potentially not
safe to use.
--------------------------

Opinions:
 I like it that characters don't double their hp with each level. It
helps to keep balance. It will help things like grenades stay
fashionable, not pitiful like in Fallout. Current leveling formula is
a bit extreme, but I prefer toning down some monsters than falling
into spiral of stupidity.

Hello, Marek! I hope we'll have many long fruitful conversations.

I am Antti Hukkanen, the amazing invisible man. I'm the guy who got really
active in the summer and basically whipped the list into a creative frenzy,
only to fall silent inexplicably for almost three months. Well, the silence
is broken now, at least...

Steve, Jakub, no, "I'm not dead yet!" (in a Monty Python-esque voice)
You know how it is - when you start putting something off, it gets easier
and easier to keep doing nothing about it. Anyway, looks like the list is
picking up. That's good. Who knows what a new member can bring...?

Hello Marek and welcome to the list.

In case you were wondering, my name is Stephen Pasquella. Yes, I'm the one to 
blame for the extreme length of the Xenocide story and the monster 
descriptions :)

It should be interesting to here what you have to say.

God Bless,

I'd like to introduce Marek to the other.
I've invited him to join this list because of his awesome ideas.
Having some time I'll translate these really interesting to discuss
them here.

True. Fixed, thanks.

Yeah, I know. I want to stay with one letter to put on and take off
armor, and - for now - I have now idea how to replace this to still use
one key for both actions.

Jakub

Hi

My name's Marek Onuszko and I'm a bit paranoid about spammers and
identity thefts. That's why my profile info doesn't quite match.

The nickname I prefer to use is B0rsuk. Alas, it's already taken.

I'm very interested in xenocide development, specifically gameplay
ideas and balance. I'll post some when I develop more. My connection
is really limited recently. Ideas can wait. Bugs can't, so here they
are(I didn't find them in group messages):
============
Major bug:

- pick up an item and activate it (chainsaw, nanoscalpel). No energy
needed.
- drop it
- go somewhere
- 't'hrow it !

The item disappears from the place on the ground, and magically flies
at your target. You can throw an item you no longer possess, as long
as you stay on the same level.
-----
Minor bug:
- the command to unequip piece of armor is called "put on"

Time sure does pass on by quickly. It's taken me quite a while, but I've 
finally gotten back to playing more Xenocide, so I thought I would take this time 
to respond to your last message, Jakub, as well as throw a few thoughts of my 
own into the mix...

Well, now you've added these sticky spit/needles, I don't think he needs 
another weapon :)
 
Though the needles do seem rather powerful. Maybe he could throw a shower 
(burst fire) of weaker needles instead of one strong one?

>> While I'm at it, I should probably type up a description for the Doc:
>
>I really like it :)
 
Well, after I reread the description, I noticed some typos. Here's a cleaned 
up version...
 
"This genetic lab was once home to a myriad of illegal experiments, all which 
have gone awry. You have witnessed with your own eyes the horrors that man 
may forge when he alters things in contrary to the natural order. But of all the 
horrors you have witness prior to this moment pale in comparison to the 
terror that now stands before you. This genetic lab was once overseen by a doctor, 
a madman who believed himself to be equal to God. Yet he was not omnipotent, 
and when his own creations turned on him, attacked him and left him for dead, 
he was forced to turn to his own twisted science to save himself. In order to 
save his life he injected into his bloodstream a myriad of mutagenic chemicals, 
each different chemical containing a sampling of alien DNA. Now he stands 
before you, no longer recognizable as a man. The DNAs of his experiments have 
merged with his own, transforming him into a thing that is neither man nor beast. 
High above you he towers, easily ten feet tall, covered from the waist up by 
a thin layer of matted, putrid, twisted fur. His arms, thick as tree trunks, 
each sport a multitude of fingers, while at the end of each finger is a 
sword-like claw. Below the waist he ceases to resemble a man in the least, his belly 
terminating in a set of chitinous, spider-esque legs. From out his back 
protrudes what would appear to be an exoskeletal tail, at the end of which rests a 
large barb that looks as if it was stripped right off of some immense 
devil-scorpion. All these things are terrifying, but the feature of the doctor that is 
most hideous of all is not one of his many bizarre appendages. No, the thing 
about him that strikes you with greatest dread is his face. Though set into a 
mass of hideous, inhuman flesh, the doctor's face is very human. It has all the 
features that one would expect to find in an old, grandfatherly man, but this 
pleasant face is twisted into a sick grin, and its cold grey eyes burn with 
an empty and hollow fire. Yes, this was once a man, but regardless of who this 
man once was, you can clearly see what he is now, and you know this; he gazed 
upon you with intent, the intent to kill. The fear swells up inside of your 
chest as he draws nearer, and you know that you have to make a choice. You can 
either fight to rid the cosmos of this thing, or you can flee to save your own 
life. With every passing second the doctor draws nearer, and so you have to 
make a choice, and fast. What will you do?"
 
There may be some other errors... I tend to type these emails rather quickly 
:(

Hmm... Maybe. I don't really like this system, because the player could be 
attacked by monsters from off screen. Unless the screen re-centres on him every 
time he moves a square (like in certain versions of Angband), in which case he 
would be able to see into the other "levels" of the desert without entering 
them.

>I plan to make desert random, non-persistent, which means that "maps"
>will be randomised on enterance, with a few exceptions.
>With such solution player "won't know where he is"
 
Ah... It's like being lost in the desert...
 
How exactly will this work?

>There will be probability:
>3% that new generated map will be enterance to the city
>3% that new generated map will be bunker-enterance power supply
>3% that new generated map will be crash-site
>3% that new generated map will be ancient ruins
>the rest 88% - new map will be desert.

I'm not really understanding this... Would the entrances to the other areas 
(i.e. city, ruins) be in the same places, with only the landscape changing, 
like the sand dunes being rearranged by the wind? Or would the entrances to the 
other areas move as well? And would you be able to walk around the perimeter of 
the city?
 
A diagram might help me understand this... Unless you just want to program 
the area, so I can witness its majesty first hand :)

>> BTW, how did the desert get so radioactive in the first place (nuking?)? 
Just a question...
>
>No, something else - natural radiation probably.


I don't know why I can never think of such simple answers...

>The logo isn't bad, but I'm not the author of the website.
>Gilus, the site maintainer, is against of any graphics on this site.


Ah, well, I can understand that. We must respect his wishes, then :)
 
So, as I said, I've been playing more Xenocide as of late. I actually managed 
to get all the way to the fourth level of the lab without dying, and then ran 
from the insanely powerful Doc and got killed by a snake man. It was very 
interesting, and very fun. Still, there should be more pills in the lab, as well 
as more new, interesting items... (*cough* rockets *cough*)
 
Anyway, I have a few more thoughts on the different levels, namely the 
Ancient Ruins and the Living Level...
 
===============================
LEVELS: Ancient Ruins - General
===============================
 
I got to thinking about the ancient ruins the other day...
 
What if said ruins were somewhat like a temple in the Greco-Roman tradition 
(or perhaps Mesopotamian? Egyptian?), being composed with lots of white, 
indestructible, marble-looking rock. Corridors would be lined with pillars or 
statues, like so:
 
#################
.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.
...@.............
.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.
#################
 
The # symbols obviously represent walls, as well as pillars. Statues might 
look like this:
 
#################
.&.&.&.&.&.&.&.&.
...@.............
.&.&.&.&.&.&.&.&.
#################
 
Said statues would probably be a golden colour, to break from the dreary 
white scheme of the walls (the floors could be a variety of hues). These statues 
would also serve a special purpose, as described below (see 'RESTLESS WATCHER').
 
I also thought that it would be interesting to include Indiana-Jones style 
traps, like where the player steps on a panel and a boulder falls down in him, 
or bolts shoot out of the walls at him, or enemies are summoned( or something).
 
In regards to the level layout, I'd say it should have long corridors, many 
like the one above, but some smaller, that connect to bigger rooms, which will 
often be lined with pillars and statues, like so...
 
###################################
#################.................#
#################..##..##..##...&&#
.&.&.&.&.&.&.&.&...##..##..##..&..#
...@.............................C#
.&.&.&.&.&.&.&.&...##..##..##..&..#
#################..##..##..##...&&#
#################.................#
###################################
 
The # are walls and pillars, the & are statues, and the C is a colossus (see 
COLOSSUS below) about to rush at the player. Bwa ha ha...
 
Of course, the ruins would be filled with vaults, and the bottom level would 
probably be pre- or semi-predefined. I had an idea; that at the bottom of the 
temple there would be a locked door that requires a key that has been broken 
into 3 parts, which have been hidden throughout the other areas of the game. 
Once this key is assembled and the door is opened, the player can journey down 
to the 'inner sanctum' of the ruined temple where he fights a boss, the 'final 
guardian' of the ruins. Defeating this would undoubtedly lead to a juicy 
artefact... perhaps a crown that lets the player use the powerful ancient weapons 
he can recover from fallen guardians (see ADAMANTINE GUARDIANS below) and 
whatnot (other ancient artefacts could be used without the crown, just not the 
common weapons). It would also increase the player's stats some, as well as acting 
as an excellent energy source.
 
As for monsters, I thought that maybe they would be guardians left by the 
Ancients to protect their ruins.
Anyway, here are the monster ideas...
 
ADAMANTINE GUARDIAN: A humanoid statue made of the same solid rock from which 
the rest of the ruins are formed, so its pretty tough, but not too fast. It 
is extremely 'intelligent', though it is not conscious, sentient, or alive by 
any means. It can use all manner of weapons, but it usually uses certain 
special 'ancient weapons' that the player cannot use. It also has a suit of gold, 
red and black armour that looks very Greco-Roman. This creature crumbles into 
dust when destroyed, leaving behind no corpse (all of these creatures do this). 
It does drop its items, though, but the player cannot use ancient weapons, 
unless, perhaps, he has a special artefact...
 
RESTLESS WATCHER: One of the many strange, gryphon-like statues that line the 
corridors of the strange ruins. They are indistinguishable from normal 
statues until they spring to life. Being made of the same rock as the adamantine 
guardians, they are tough, though not as tough as the guardian, though they are 
somewhat faster. In addition to their armour piercing claws (very powerful!), 
they can also 'spit' balls of destructive energy from their mouths that explode 
when they hit solid matter. In addition, they can levitate off of the ground, 
allowing them to 'fly' over any traps or pitfalls on the ground. It would be 
wise to attack these from a distance using powerful firearms, since their 
claws make quick work of armour and flesh alike.
 
COLOSSUS: Think the adamantine guardian, only much larger, tougher, slower, 
and with a big horned head ala the minotaur. This is the biggest and toughest 
of the monsters in the ruins. Though it has no ranged attacks, it can carry a 
variety of extremely large and powerful Ancient melee weapons. It can also 
smash the player with its horns to stun him and knock him back a few squares, as 
well as doing some damage. This is the kind of thing you save your explosives 
for. Hm... what if it took up 4 squares and thus could only guard its large 
rooms, not being able to venture into the smaller corridors. And speaking of 
four-tile monsters, isn't Herr Doktor supposed to be 4-tiles in size?
 
FERAL SENTRY: A puma-like creature made of ruin-rock that can literally 
"smell" the player and hone in on him by following the trail of his scent. In 
addition, these creatures can perform a powerful 'jumping attack' where it leaps 
into the air and flies at the player from a distance (can only be performed from 
afar, several squares. If you've ever played the FPS "Quake", then you know 
about the fiend's jump attack... same idea, really).
 
MATTER LORD: A drone made of jet-black ruin-rock. It absorbs any matter that 
hits it, and uses said matter to heal/strengthen itself. Can only be killed by 
energy, and is extremely weak against it. Can fire "bullets" at the player.
 
ANGELESQUE: A drone made of a light, shining crystal, whose form somewhat 
resembles the classical depiction of an angel. It absorbs energy that hits it, 
and uses said energy to heal/strengthen itself. Can only be killed by material 
weapons, and is extremely weak against them. Can fire bursts of energy at 
player.
 
CRYSTAL DRONE: Like an energy sentry gun, the crystal drone is a stationary 
crystal that will fire bolts of energy at the player. In addition to doing 
this, the crystal drone will also alert all the adamantine guardians (and 
colossuses, and everything else) on the level to the player's presence, even if they 
can't see him themselves. This means that the player will have to move fast 
once he's spotted by said drone, or there could be a lot of trouble.
 
BOUNCER (working name): A large crystalline sphere surrounded by an energy 
shield. The idea behind this creature is that any bullet or beam that is shot at 
it bounces off of it and back at the player. Of course, repeated attacking 
can wear down its field, but since all projectiles and LASERs bounce back, it 
would be best to engage it in melee combat, because though your weapon might 
bounce off of it, it won't hurt you in doing so, unlike bullets would. Also, a 
grenade tossed right next to it can do some damage (though if the grenade hits 
it it could bounce back at the player).
 
SPATIAL DISPLACER: A scarab-like creature (made of rock, once more) that can 
warp space and time to some degree. Though weak, it has the ability to 
teleport itself anywhere it desires, and it can also slow the player down from a 
distance using its time powers. It can also speed itself up.
 
DRACON: The animate statue of a dragon that can spit 'liquid fire' in the 
player's direction (kind of like a flamethrower).
 
WALL-CRAWLER: A large snake-like construct that can pass through the walls, 
kind of like the 'stone snake' in ADoM. It is weaker than most monsters in the 
level, but it can retreat into the walls to rest and heal itself. It also 
might be able to spit a poisonous 'fang' at the player from a close range...
 
Anyway, that about does it for the monster ideas...
 
Oh, and Jakub, I think I know what to replace the 'underground' with, namely 
'the ancient city'. This would be similar to the ruins in flavour, but bigger, 
less like a temple and more like a city. It would probably be filled with 
more powerful guardian monster. The Enemy has also occupied it, setting up small 
strongholds (vaults filled with Enemy troops that the Ancient Guardians cannot 
invade) where they study the ancient technologies firsthand.
 
==============================
LEVELS: Living Level - General
==============================
 
Now onto part two of this email, the living level...
 
As for the level, I imagined it to be made up of walls of pink flesh 
(destructible, but tough, and it heals itself quickly, can even regenerate) and bone 
(nearly indestructible), both of which can regenerate over long periods of 
time. When I thought of this level, I imagined long, organic corridors connecting 
to medium-sized round rooms. I also imagined organic 'doors' that are touch 
sensitive, opening when touched. I also imagined rooms and corridors that could 
expand and contract at regular intervals, to give the level a feeling of 
livingness (like a beating heart). Also, corridors could 'waver', like this...
 
this...
 
###        #########    #######
...########.........####.......####
......@............................
...########.........####.......####
###        #########    #######
 
becomes this (after a few turns)...
 
   ########         ####       ####
###........#########....#######....
......@............................
###........#########....#######....
   ########         ####       ####
 
If the player were standing in an open space that contracted, he would merely 
be pushed aside, like so...
 
he goes from here...
 
###        #########    #######
...########...@.....####.......####
...................................
...########.........####.......####
###        #########    #######
 
to here...
 
   ########         ####       ####
###........#########....#######....
..............@....................
###........#########....#######....
   ########         ####       ####
 
Of course, only certain corridors would do this, and there would be ways of 
temporarily stopping it, like shooting the walls and causing them to contract 
temporarily, or shooting a 'nerve point' in a wall causing it to simply stop 
moving until the nerve heals (maybe).
 
Well, those are just my ideas for the level... take e'm or leave 'em.
 
Now for some monster ideas...
 
BIODEFS: Minute, flying biological defenders of the living level. Think of 
them likes super antibodies. These things are really weak, but they're quite 
annoying since their attacks are electrical and stand a small chance of stunning 
the player (maybe they travel in swarms, like my suggested piranha swarm?). Of 
course, they come in large numbers, due to the...
 
BIOSPAWNER: A creature built into the wall that begins slowly (but 
continuously) spawning biodefs whenever the player enters its level. The only ways for 
the player to stop the biodef production are to either leave the level of the 
biospawner, or to kill it. Since biospawners are built into walls, when they 
die they leave just a plain section of wall behind. Biospawners spawn biodefs 
very slowly, but there would be a lot of them on ever level, meaning that the 
player would have to take them out as soon as he sees them, or risk being 
swamped by biodefs.
 
PURGER: A large white blob of protoplasmic goo (think super white blood 
cell). A powerful enemy, it has the ability to suck the player "into" it. The 
player then stands on the creature like it was a normal tile, and proceeds to have 
his life force drained. The only was to escape is to kill the creature from 
the inside by trying to move (attacking it in melee) or by firing a weapon.
 
GATEKEEPER: An evil creature that guards the Living Level's organic 'doors'. 
It must be killed before the door will open. Not found on all doors, just 
some, and you can't tell guarded doors apart from the non-guarded doors. Can 
attack from a distance, maybe using energy? Can bite the player when he stands next 
to the door, and can *really* hurt him if he tries to open the guarded door...
 
WALKING WALL: The walking wall is a section of wall that disguises itself as 
a section of normal wall. One can position itself in a hallway and trap a 
player, or a group can lie in wait inside of a room, waiting for the player to 
enter so they can spring to like and surround him. Very tough to kill, but 
relatively little armour and attacking power.
 
CLEANSING FLEA: Unlike most fleas, this creature is not a parasite. Rather, 
it is a monkey-sized life form that exists in symbiosis with the Living Level. 
It feeds off of the level's blood, removing impurities and using them to 
satiate itself, and then regurgitating the clean fluids back into the level. This 
creature can drain the player's blood (vampiric), as well as "jump" short 
distances ('jumping' being teleporting within a room, i.e. not being able to pass 
through walls).
 
Well, that's all for the level ideas...
 
So now I have just a few random thoughts that I had regarding various things, 
some new items and what not...
 
FLASH-BANG: A new kind of grenade. It can briefly blind enemies (you'd have 
to implement blindness) as well as "muddle" them (they stagger whenever they 
try to move, like being "stunned" in ADoM). Of course, this can be used against 
the player as well.
 
TRACTOR-BEAM DEVICE: Not sure if this was suggested or not yet. What about a 
"tractor-beam" typr of tool that lets the player grab ammo and weapons from a 
distance.
 
SHOCK-SCOURGE: A long metallic whip with an electrified tip. Normally used 
for taming animals, it can be used well in melee combat, and can also be "fired" 
to attack across several squares. Equally good melee or ranged
 
BIO-SCANNER: A device that gives the player all the stats, strengths and 
weaknesses of most organic enemies.
 
ENERGY-CONVERTER: A battery that can convert junk into energy to recharge 
itself. The amount of energy gained from an item depends on its weight, but it 
can only hold so much energy.
 
SOUND "KNOCKER": A gun-like device originally used by miners to flush 
creatures out of the shadows. This device acts like a ventriloquist, making knocking 
sounds bounce off of whatever it hits. This can distract enemies, causing them 
to leave the area and giving the player a free path (this would only be 
useful if 'stealth' were implemented, because the player would have to use this 
device before the monster noticed him).
 
DART PISTOL: What if there was another "improvised" weapon, like a 
dart-pistol that shot tranquilliser (slow), poison, and muscle relaxant (stun) darts? 
These darts would do no damage but would inflict status ailments. These would 
make sense in the lab, since the scientist would need a way to stun animals in 
case they broke free.
 
MINING LAMP: An electric lantern used by miners (maybe affixed to a helmet?), 
it increases the player's range of view.
 
ROCKETS: I was thinking about rockets in Xenocide. What if, when a rocket was 
launched, it only travelled three squares on the first turn, but the next 
turn in continued to travel, moving five squares this time, and then seven the 
next. So it's like it picks up speed over time (smaller missiles would probably 
travel instantly). 'Smart' rockets could slow down and partially change 
direction for the purpose of hitting an enemy that's trying to run away.
 
SPY DRONE: A special kind of device that the player can use to "spy" around 
the corner. The player remains in place while he gains control of the drone, 
which hovers around the level, exploring hitherto uncharted areas. The only 
problem is that the player cannot see the area around himself while controlling 
the spy, and is only aware of an enemy if it hits him.
 
ATTACK DRONE: A version of the spy drone armed with light armour and a small 
air-taser for attacking enemies.
 
BOMB DRONE: A version of the spy drone that can be detonated upon request of 
the player, meaning he can pilot it around a corner into a group of Genotroids 
and then blow them all to ashes!
 
ANCIENT WEAPONS: I just thought I'd list my ideas for 'Ancient weapons' that 
the adamantine guardians would use (just so you know what I'm talking about):
 
      Power Rod - A short rod with a large crystal head that can shoot small 
bolts of energy. It has its own "energy clip" that recharges one point per 
turn.
 
      Power Staff - A bigger version of the aura rod, this is a long staff 
that can shoot both a single burst of energy as well as three. It has its own 
"energy clip" that recharges one point per turn.
 
      Aura Blade - A sword with a shimmering blade of pure energy, it can cut 
through most anything. No energy required.
 
      Thunder Glove - A small gauntlet worn by the guardians, it can shoot 
strong bursts of electricity that stun the player. It can also do quite a bit of 
damage in melee, electrocuting the player.
 
Brief notes, bugs, etc:
 
I notice that when dropping or picking up items, if you just hit ENTER at the 
'how many' prompt, a little flashing cursor appears on the screen, and 
doesn't leave. This happened in the DOS version of Xenocide run under Windows ME.
 
I have noticed numerous English errors and have tried to compile a list of 
some of them...
 
"You eat the pill. You feel not so radiated." Should say "You swallow the 
pill" [pills are swallowed, not eaten :)], "You blood has been cleansed of all 
radiation."
 
Also, though 'radiated' isn't the right word for being poisoned by radiation, 
I think that it actually works quite well in the context.
 
"You eat the pill. Your blood don't burn so much." should say "You swallow 
the pill. Your blood no longer burns as much as it did a moment ago."
 
"This makes the stainy worm a potentially deadly foe" should read" "This 
makes the stained worm a potentially deadly foe." (my bad...)

Also, "bangs on" doesn't sound quite right in English. It would just be 
better, in my opinion, to have most smaller blunt weapons display "hits" or 
"strikes" and have heavier ones say things like "bashes" or "slams". As for "smites", 
I think that that should be saved for artefacts, seeing how 'smite' in the 
modern English language conveys a sense of majesty (i.e., it is usually only 
used to describe actions of God, as in "God smites his foes". It is a rather 
archaic word, and is not used too often in modern English.). The baton can 
probably be used to "strike" or "hit" a foe, or maybe even "zap".
 
Anyway, I've rambled on long enough in this message. Good luck with Xenocide, 
Jakub, and life in general.
 
God Bless,
 
   -Steve

You have witnessed with your own eyes the horrors that man may forge when he alters things in contrary to the natural order. But of all the horrors you have witness prior to this moment pale in comparison to the terror that now stands before you. This genetic lab was once overseen by a doctor, a madman who believed himself to be equal to God. Yet he was not omnipotent, and when his own creations turned on him, attacked him and left him for dead, he was forced to turn to his own twisted science to save himself. In order to save his life he injected into his bloodstream a myriad of mutagenic chemicals, each different chemical containing a sampling of alien DNA. Now he stands before you, no longer recognizable as a man. The DNAs of his experiments have merged with his own, transforming him into a thing that is neither man nor beast. High above you he towers, easily ten feet tall, covered from the waist up by a thin layer of matted, putrid, twisted fur. His arms, thick as tree trunks, each sport a multitude of fingers, while at the end of each finger is a sword-like claw. Below the waist he ceases to resemble a man in the least, his belly terminating in a set of chitinous, spider-esque legs. From out his back protrudes what would appear to be an exoskeletal tail, at the end of which rests a large barb that looks as if it was stripped right off of some immense devil-scorpion. All these things are terrifying, but the feature of the doctor that is most hideous of all is not one of his many bizarre appendages. No, the thing about him that strikes you with greatest dread is his face. Though set into a mass of hideous, inhuman flesh, the doctor's face is very human. It has all the features that one would expect to find in an old, grandfatherly man, but this pleasant face is twisted into a sick grin, and its cold grey eyes burn with an empty and hollow fire. Yes, this was once a man, but regardless of who this man once was, you can clearly see what he is now, and you know this; he gazed upon you with intent, the intent to kill. The fear swells up inside of your chest as he draws nearer, and you know that you have to make a choice. You can either fight to rid the cosmos of this thing, or you can flee to save your own life. With every passing second the doctor draws nearer, and so you have to make a choice, and fast. What will you do?"<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Of course, the ruins would be filled with vaults, and the bottom level would probably be pre- or semi-predefined. I had an idea; that at the bottom of the temple there would be a locked door that requires a key that has been broken into 3 parts, which have been hidden throughout the other areas of the game. Once this key is assembled and the door is opened, the player can journey down to the 'inner sanctum' of the ruined temple where he fights a boss, the 'final guardian' of the ruins. Defeating this would undoubtedly lead to a juicy artefact... perhaps a crown that lets the player use the powerful ancient weapons he can recover from fallen guardians (see ADAMANTINE GUARDIANS below) and whatnot (other ancient artefacts could be used without the crown, just not the common weapons). It would also increase the player's stats some, as well as acting as an excellent energy source.</FONT></SPAN></P>

It is extremely 'intelligent', though it is not conscious, sentient, or alive by any means. It can use all manner of weapons, but it usually uses certain special 'ancient weapons' that the player cannot use. It also has a suit of gold, red and black armour that looks very Greco-Roman. This creature crumbles into dust when destroyed, leaving behind no corpse (all of these creatures do this). It does drop its items, though, but the player cannot use ancient weapons, unless, perhaps, he has a special artefact...</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">RESTLESS WATCHER: One of the many strange, gryphon-like statues that line the corridors of the strange ruins. They are indistinguishable from normal statues until they spring to life. Being made of the same rock as the adamantine guardians, they are tough, though not as tough as the guardian, though they are somewhat faster. In addition to their armour piercing claws (very powerful!), they can also 'spit' balls of destructive energy from their mouths that explode when they hit solid matter. In addition, they can levitate off of the ground, allowing them to 'fly' over any traps or pitfalls on the ground. It would be wise to attack these from a distance using powerful firearms, since their claws make quick work of armour and flesh alike.</FONT></SPAN></P>

This is the biggest and toughest of the monsters in the ruins. Though it has no ranged attacks, it can carry a variety of extremely large and powerful Ancient melee weapons. It can also smash the player with its horns to stun him and knock him back a few squares, as well as doing some damage. This is the kind of thing you save your explosives for. Hm... what if it took up 4 squares and thus could only guard its large rooms, not being able to venture into the smaller corridors. And speaking of four-tile monsters, isn't Herr Doktor supposed to be 4-tiles in size?</FONT></SPAN></P>

The idea behind this creature is that any bullet or beam that is shot at it bounces off of it and back at the player. Of course, repeated attacking can wear down its field, but since all projectiles and LASERs bounce back, it would be best to engage it in melee combat, because though your weapon might bounce off of it, it won't hurt you in doing so, unlike bullets would. Also, a grenade tossed right next to it can do some damage (though if the grenade hits it it could bounce back at the player).</FONT></SPAN></P>

The only ways for the player to stop the biodef production are to either leave the level of the biospawner, or to kill it. Since biospawners are built into walls, when they die they leave just a plain section of wall behind. Biospawners spawn biodefs very slowly, but there would be a lot of them on ever level, meaning that the player would have to take them out as soon as he sees them, or risk being swamped by biodefs.</FONT></SPAN></P>

I'll do some test by myself too, I have not time now,

Just a quick bug report. I noticed that sometimes when I'm in the mines, and 
I try to use a lift, the game crashes. This seems to only happen after I've 
been attacked by a walking bomb, but this may just be coincidence. Once the game 
crashes while using the lift, then the character that experienced this bug 
can never use another lift. The game will always crash when he tries to.
 
I would have attributed this to the malfunctions of my awful computer if 
someone hadn't posted about a similar bug in r.g.r.d.
 
This happened while running the DOS version under Windows Millennium Edition. 
I will try to replicate it and send in a save file with the character plagued 
by this error.
 
Until then,
 
God Bless,
 
-Steve

Ok, now he is changed - he runs away only when he really has a few hit
points, and then he gets bonus +10 to speed.

Good idea, done.

I thought exactly about the same, but I had no time to implement such things.
Instead now he can spit sticky spittle that slows down the player, and
shoot needles, like medium/large critters will do.

Maybe I'll give him some, but I think now he's fine enough :)

true, changed.

Thanks, such desciptions are extremaly useful for me.
Having a set of ideas I know how to do customizable implementation.

I thought about the same, but then i thought up something else.
What if the screen was like that (fixed size font required)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Invisible "staircase" would be on every border cell. If player
reach that place, then he would be automatically moved into the "other
region", to the center of it.
Map could "scroll" in such situation.

Player goes north (Y is a cactus, . is a hole)

He reaches the border

>           >
>           >

Map is scrolled, cactus moved down, hole is out of the map,
'm' appears.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>

>>>>>>>>>>>>>

It's just an idea now. What do you think?


I plan to make desert random, non-persistent, which means that "maps"
will be randomised on enterance, with a few exceptions.
With such solution player "won't know where he is"

There will be probability:
3% that new generated map will be enterance to the city
3% that new generated map will be bunker-enterance power supply
3% that new generated map will be crash-site
3% that new generated map will be ancient ruins
the rest 88% - new map will be desert.
Maybe these values will change depending how far player will move to
the west.

> BTW, how did the desert get so radioactive in the first place (nuking?)? Just a question...

No, something else - natural radiation probably.

> Now, I just have one more game-related thought. What if certain

Now radiation is a kind of slow poison. In the future I plan to change
it a bit -> radiated monster will have chance to mutate it's stats
(str, int etc.)
3 to 1 that mutation will be adverse.

The logo isn't bad, but I'm not the author of the website.
Gilus, the site maintainer, is against of any graphics on this site.

I should probably elaborate on what I meant by 'strange'. It seems to me that 
the Doctor is a bit of a coward. I mean, I get him down to 50% health with my 
chainsaw (using the test character) and he just runs away. Wouldn't it be 
better if he was so crazy that he felt no fear, and getting closer to dying just 
made him stronger, like an animal backed into a corner?
 
I do have a few more suggestions about Herr Doktor. I really like the fact 
that he can throw the player, but I think that throwing should cause a bit more 
damage and stand a good chance of stunning the player. Also, I noticed that he 
doesn't have any ranged attacks. What about putting big chunks of masonry or 
ruined lab equipment in the lab that the Doc can hurl at the player? His aim 
wouldn't be too accurate, of course, but it would at least keep the player on 
his toes.
 
Also, I was amazed by the fact that the Doc can switch unarmed melee weapons. 
What is he had a third set of weapons, tentacles or something, that were 
vampiric?
 
(Speaking of vampiric, now that the vampire bat has different teeth, I'll 
need to change it's description:
 
"This flying mammal doesn't resemble the vampire bats that one would find on 
Earth. Instead of merely draining the blood of its victim, this creature uses 
its fangs to metabolise the player's haemoglobin in order to heal its own 
wounds. Add that to the fact that it moves extremely fast, and you've got one 
deadly predator."
 
While I'm at it, I should probably type up a description for the Doc:
 
"This genetic lab was once home to a myriad of illegal experiments, all which 
have gone awry. You have witnessed with your own eyes the horrors that man 
may forge when he alters nature against the natural order. But all of the 
horrors you have witness prior to this moment pale in comparison to the terror that 
now stands before you. This genetic lab was once overseen by a doctor, a mad 
man who believed himself to be equal to God. Yet he was not omnipotent, and 
when his own creations turned on him and left him for dead, he was forced to turn 
to his own twisted science to save himself. In order to save himself he 
injected into his bloodstream a myriad of mutagenic chemicals, each different 
chemical containing a sampling of alien DNA. Now he stands before you, no longer 
recognizable as a man. The DNAs of his experiments have merged with his own, 
transforming him into a thing that is neither man nor beast. High above you he 
towers, easily ten feet tall, covered from the waist up by a thin layer of 
matted, putrid, twisted fur. His arms, thick as tree trunks, each sport a multitude 
of fingers, while at the end of each finger is a sword-like claw. Below the 
waist he ceases to resemble a man in the least, his belly terminating in a set 
of chitinous, spider-esque legs. From out his back protrudes what would appear 
to be an exoskeletal tail, at the end of which rests a large barb that looks 
as if it was stripped right off of some immense devil-scorpion. All these 
things are terrifying, but the feature of the doctor that is most hideous of all 
is not one of his many bizarre appendages. No, the thing about him that strikes 
you with greatest dread is his face. Though set into a mass of hideous, 
inhuman flesh, the doctor's face is very human. It has all the features that one 
would expect to find in an old, grandfatherly man, but this pleasant face is 
twisted into a sick grin, and its cold grey eyes burn with an empty and hollow 
fire. Yes, this was once a man, but regardless of who this man once was, you can 
see that what he is now, and you know this; he gazed upon you with intent, 
the intent to kill. The fear swells up inside of your chest as he draws nearer, 
and you know that you have to make a choice. You can either fight to rid the 
cosmos of this thing, or you can flee to save your own life. With every passing 
moment the doctor draws nearer, and so you have to make a choice, and fast. 
What will you do?"
 
I hope that wasn't too verbose. And if you want me to change anything about 
his description, just say the word.)
 
Anyway, nice work on the Doc, Jakub.
 
>If I have some free time, I'll implement laser weapons now. And then
>some new monsters.
 
Ah, I have some monster ideas for the Radioactive Desert (I think most, but 
not all, creatures here should have radiation attacks. Even those that aren't 
extremely radioactive should probably stand a chance of infecting the player 
with radiation whenever they attack in melee). I hope you enjoy them...
 
(Warning: Typed up in hasted, expect numerous grammatical errors.)
 
Aura Bug: Once a member of the species of ordinary insects that populated the 
desert, this creature became infected by radiation and grew to an abnormal 
size. Now it is surrounded by a perpetual aura of radiation that infects 
anything that gets near it (within one square), thus making it hard to approach. You 
would have to kill it from a distance, seeing how it doesn't even need to 
attack to give the player radiation poisoning (or at least bad burns).
 
Land Shark: A large desert predator, this creature moves about the sands as a 
shark moves through water. It has the ability to dive under the desert, so 
that the player can only see its fin sticking up out of the ground. While the 
player cannot harm it while it is submerged (though armour piercing bullets and 
explosives may be able to penetrate the sand), it cannot harm the player, 
either. Only once it emerges from the ground can it attack, and then the player 
can hurt it, too.
 
Dust-Devil: A large, hairy, bipedal mammal that has the ability to spin 
itself very fast, turning to a small cyclone of claws and fangs. Not only is this 
cyclone form powerful, but it also kicks up clouds of sand that obscure the 
player's vision. The Dust-Devil's weakness comes from the fact that he can only 
hold his cyclone form for a limited time, and afterward he is dizzy and 
stunned, having to rest for several turns before he can spin again. Probably a more 
powerful enemy in the desert.
 
Death Blossom: What was once a harmless desert flower has mutated into a 
radioactive nightmare. The Death Blossom looks like a large shrub, but it can 
sprout crab legs and move around on its own. It also has a radioactive stinger 
that it uses to kill its prey. Maybe it can also suck up the nutrients from 
corpses? (This creature would be particularly deadly if there were normal "shrubs" 
scattered about the desert that didn't do much of anything much, so that the 
player wouldn't know whether or not he was seeing a real shrub or a monster).
 
Radio-Slug: A large radioactive slug with a pair of large mandibles (or an 
octopus-like beak). It just so happens that when said creature is killed, it 
melts, leaving a semi-permanent scorching radioactive puddle behind (said puddle 
would probably disappear after several thousand turns).
 
Flare Lizard: A dog-sized lizard capable of occasionally breathing small 
bursts of hot flame across short distances.
 
Particle Lizard: A stronger, larger, more mutated flare lizard with hardened 
scales and radioactive breath.
 
Deathtoll Scorpion: Inspired by the fact that our insane friend Herr Doktor 
can switch unarmed weapons (kudos, Jakub), the Deathtoll Scorpion has two 
unarmed melee weapons. He can either attack with his pincers, which attack twice 
per turn and do a decent ammount of damage, or he cn attack with his stinger, 
which poisons, radiates (though 'radiate' isn't the right word for being 
infected by radiation poisoning... It should probably just be "Rad. Poisoning' with 
'Rad' being the abbreviation. So the message would read "the player has been 
rad. poisoned". Not exactly perfect English, but it works.), and can punch 
through armour. The draw back is that the stinger does very little damage compared 
to the pincers (which don't poison or punch through armour). This creature 
would probably attack by first trying to poison the player using its stinger and 
then finishing the player off with its pincers.
 
Cactus Fiend: Neither a plant nor an animal, it is a gorilla-like monster 
with a tough, thorny hide. It is a master of melee combat, and can take quite a 
beating before dying. Also, players who engage it in melee combat will often 
get stuck with spines when they try and attack it. Definitely the kind of thing 
you want to save your bullets for, so you can attack it from afar..
 
Opticor: A giant eyeball that moves around like a slug (or maybe it floats or 
walks on tentacles or something like that...). It can shoot radioactive 
eye-beams, as well as use its 'hypnotic stare' to slow the player from a distance. 
(I know, I know, very stereotypical, but I'm fond of such hideous creatures.).
 
Sand Crawler: It's... A giant sandworm. No, no, wait... *sigh* (You know, 
I've yet to read "Dune"). But anyway, the Sand Crawler is a hideous mutant worm 
(or possibly a snake) that can spit sand into the player's eyes, thus 
temporarily blinding him. This sand is also radioactive, and it can occasionally give 
the player radiation poisoning.
 
Now I have a few thoughts on the desert...
 
I was thinking that said desert should be composed mostly of open spaces 
separated by walls of organic looking rock. Progressing from one section to the 
other could probably be achieved by finding a 'staircase' built into a wall, 
similar to how you travel in the city. What do you think of that, Jakub? Did ou 
ave a similar idea in mind?
 
BTW, how did the desert get so radioactive in the first place (nuking?)? Just 
a question...
 
Now, I just have one more game-related thought. What if certain enemies, when 
hitting the player, could stand the chance of 'mutating' them. This wouldn't 
be done via radiation, but rather it would be done via mutagenic chemicals. As 
the player is infected more and more, he starts gaining minor mutations 
(strength/weakness, increased/decreased vision, resistance/weakness to different 
attacks) and in time could get more powerful mutations (infravision, aqua-lungs, 
etc.). Of course, mutations could be easily removed using the genetic 
machine... I just wish I could get that special card to do something...
 
Anyway, one more thing and then I'm done, this time in relation to the 
Xenocide website. I got to thinking, what the Xenocide site needs is a nice graphic 
logo. So I threw one together using my photo-editor, and I've included it as 
an attachment (in PNG format). I hope yahoo groups sends attachments through. 
Anyway, its just an idea. Tell me what you think.
 
So, anyway, keep up the good work Jakub. I'll keep thinking up ideas, as I'm 
sure Antti is, wherever he is...
 
God Bless,
 
-Steve

Of course, mutations could be easily removed using the genetic machine... I just wish I could get that special card to do something...</FONT></SPAN></P>

I got to thinking, what the Xenocide site needs is a nice graphic logo. So I threw one together using my photo-editor, and I've included it as an attachment (in PNG format). I hope yahoo groups sends attachments through. Anyway, its just an idea. Tell me what you think.</FONT></SPAN></P>

Well... If I only had more time. I understand Thomas Biskup now with his
"gime me a million dolars and I'll spend the time only on Adom"...

Thanks.

If I have some free time, I'll implement laser weapons now. And then
some new monsters.

Jakub

Nice work with the new version, Jakub. I was surprised to see how much you 
had done in such short time. The electricity and radiation especially surprised 
me. Ah, and seeing the Mad Doctor hurl me across the room was very 
interesting, though I think his AI is a little strange.
 
Anyway, good work, and congratulations on the promotion. All these new 
features are giving me lots of monster ideas... I'll have to type some up and send 
them to the list soon.
 
God Bless,
 
-Steve

Hi,

Finally I found sound some time for Xenocide. So, the game is not dead
and won't be. :)
Soon I plan to put an update on the website, because I'm having less
and less free time :/ All because of work, I've got a promotion...

I made some changes and improvements, but the main addition is the
"Mad Doctor" in the 4th level of Genetic Lab.
He has some special abilities, hope you like them.

The version is available here:
http://www.graveyard.roguelikedevelopment.org/files/xeno_test.zip

As always in test version you can choose 't' in on "select training"
screen to get a "TEST Player" with some additional equipment/skills.

regards,
Jakub

Well... You're right, it does simplify things a great deal. And it will 
probably be better in terms of gameplay. Though I wonder if LASER guns will be a 
bit too powerful since they don't have to be reloaded...
 
And if it makes it easier to give monsters energy, then I guess it's for the 
better.

Ah, okay. I was wondering how the regen property factored in.

It happened once. I'll try and make it happen again. Like I said, the problem 
is probably with my computer, and not with Xenocide.
 
My computer tends to crash programs with some regularity. So don't worry 
about it...
 
>how did it crashed? Which version made it? DOS? Windows?
 
Well, I managed to get the DOS version to work under windows (I have Windows 
ME. Usually I can't get DOS programs to run under windows at all...). I just 
walked into the gas cloud a few steps and the thing crashed, with many, many 
numbers being displayed on the screen. But like I said, it's probably my 
computer that's at fault, not Xenocide.

No problem :)

Yeah, that would be a good idea. I think that burdening should encure more 
negative effects. Maybe once the player is carrying 1/4 of his capacity then he 
is slightly burdened, 2/4 and he is burdened, 3/4 and he is really burdened, 
4/4 and he is super-burdened, so much that he can't move. That's just my 
suggestion.
 
Anyway, I'll play some more, and send feedback. I'm really starting to like 
these gas grenades.
 
God Bless,

I thought about it, but I don't want to do battery management, energy
transfers etc. It would be nothing than annoying, but yes, more
realistic.
Now player can improve any item adding some special "energy features",
like MOD_STR to armor or MOD_ACC to weapon. Every such improvement
requires energy. Now player can really fast calculate what is worth to
turn on and how much energy is used.
With batteries to put into items, he should check all the time which item
still have energy and is battery have to be replaced.
Only more actions to do, but the gameplay wouldn't be improved.
IMHO it's not worth to change. Sometimes simplifications are good.

> seems kind of silly...

Maybe it's. Moreover - it simplify powering implants in future.
Player can install a implant, but he need energy for it to work.
It allows monsters that do not wear any batteries (animals)
to have some energy (like a Electric Eel).

> But that's just me.

Yeah, I know, such solution for energy seems to be weird, but I really
fought a lot about it and think it's the best.

It's something like that. Monster have Energy/Sum_of_Battery_Capacity
and it's drained when energy is used.
The tricky thing is recharging in batteries.
If battery have some self-recharging features (REGEN), it regenerates
an energy of owner up to the capacity of battery.

So, if player has:
2xMining Battery (Capacity 40, Regen 1/10) and Self-Charging
Accumulator (Capacity 100, Regen 1/1)
then his Sum of Battery Capacity (EP.MAX) is 2x40 + 100 = 180
but Mining Battery regenerates energy if player's EP is below 40,
and Self-Charging Accumulator regenerates energy if player's EP < 100.

It's because of game balance (energy regenerated by items up to EP.MAX
are too high)

> Also, Jakub, now that chainsaws and drills use energy, shouldn't they be a bit more powerful?

Ok, they will be.

Is that happened once? Or it happens always?
I haven't seen that by myself :/

Thanks A LOT for your time :)

As I see I have to change a bit level of burdening and it's
disadventages.

Jakub

Well, I've played the test version a couple of times. Just a few thoughts...

Hey, Jakub, wouldn't it be better to have the player have to insert the 
batteries into weapons/items? You know, similar to how things are in real life.
 
I just think that the prospect of weapons, armour and items draining energy 
right from the batteries in the player's inventory seems kind of silly...
 
But that's just me.
 
I wouldn't know how to implement such a system, but you could try setting the 
battery's energy capacity up like the HP is set up for all items (e.g. 
500/500), and have a certain amount of energy be drained out of the battery every 
time said item is used or for every turn it is activated.
 
Also, Jakub, now that chainsaws and drills use energy, shouldn't they be a 
bit more powerful?

>- Added gas grenades (still there are no gas masks)


I tested a few of the gas grenades. The game actually crashed as I was 
walking through a cloud of paralysing gas. I'll have to see if I can replicate the 
bug, or if it was just my computer acting up again (it's not a very healthy 
computer).

>- Added shortcut keys to activate weapon (;) and armor (').


Ah, good. I was going to suggest this.
 
In short, the new version is good. I like what I've seen so far :)
 
Though, like I said, I'm not too fond of the energy system.
 
Anyway, I'll play some more and send in more feedback shortly.
 
God Bless,
 
   -Steve

Hello group,

I'm on the coding spree again :)
Slowly I implement all the discussed things.

The changes are:
- I've changed the energy system. There will be only one type of
energy (yeah, I know, it looks like a mana points...). Description how
self-recharging batteries work I'll write soon.
- If the game has to pause for calculations, in the left-top corner of the screen a moving sign appears.
(for slow computers)
- Added gas grenades (still there are no gas masks)
- Only the first message of many the same is shown on the console (to
cut down 100 times "Player has been..." in gases.
- Monsters can be burdened or strained when carry too heavy items.
(burdened when carry more than 2/3, Strained when more than 3/4, both
with speed reduction)
and some older changes:
- You can put your name as a game parameter (f.e. to start as Jakub run: xenocide_win.exe Jakub )
- Added power supply and energy tools.
- Added shortcut keys to activate weapon (;) and armor (').

feel free to test it:
http://www.roguelikedevelopment.org/graveyard/files/xeno_test.zip

On the screen where you choose your training, hit 't' key to start
as a TEST Player, who is in Power Armor, with Chainsaw and has a few
other items.

Now it's time to do new monsters.

regards,
Jakub

Just a small info:

Well... I don't like the way how the energy works and I will change it
today (or tomorrow).
Damn, I hate to delete code I have written... :/

Hi

The new test version is out.
http://www.roguelikedevelopment.org/graveyard/files/xeno_test.zip
Changes:

- You can put your name as a game parameter (f.e. to start as Jakub run: xenocide_win.exe Jakub)
- Added power supply and energy tools (you can activate your Chainsaw
or Mining Drill, or Power Armor)
- Added shortcut keys to activate weapon (;) and armor (').

For testing purposes:
- On the screen where you choose your training, hit 't' key to start
as a TEST Player, that is in Power Armor, with Chainsaw and has a few
other items.

To do now:
Energy Tools to install on armors (like the one in Power Armor) and on
weapons (laser scope etc.)

Turning on armor that incrases stats (STR, DEX...) consumes energy
very fast. Weapon consumes energy only when used. The same is with
armors that have some additional features when activated - consume
eneregy only when used.

regards,
Jakub

Hello everyone. In case you had not noticed, I haven't been very active on 
this list recently. This is because I've been rather busy, in addition to being 
rather sick. So I haven't really had time to write responses to anything that 
was said, but I do have a few thoughts to share on Xeno.
 
Before I begin, I think that it might be best if every mail sent to the list 
was broken up into categories. This is due to the chaotic nature the messages 
in our group tend to have. I thought of breaking the discussions up under the 
headings of GAMEPLAY (classes, skills, combat, implants, xp, misc), NPCs 
(general, properties, abilities, tactics, new creatures, old creatures, robots, 
uniques, misc), ITEMS (weapons, armour, tools, pills, artefacts, misc), LEVELS, 
STORY, OTHER (anything not listed above). To get such a system in circulation, 
I've decided to give it a "test run" in this message. I think that it'll 
really help get things organized, without stifling anyone's creativity.
 
Anyway...
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
==========================
GAMEPLAY: Skills - Biology
==========================
 
What if there was a "biology skill" that would allow players to locate and 
aim for the vital organs/arteries of certain creatures, thus increasing the 
critical hit rate? Hence, the medic (who would surely be very knowledgeable of 
biology) would be given a (slight) special advantage above the other classes.
 
============================
GAMEPLAY: Skills - Chemistry
============================
 
Well, I have already proposed a 'chemistry' system, but I though that I would 
just elaborate on it a bit more.
 
Like I said, one could extract chemicals from dead enemies (poison, paralysis 
fluid, etc.) or items (maybe fungi or herbs that are lying around) using a 
'chemical extractor'. The extractor is disposable, and once used it becomes a 
vial with said chemical in it.
 
Said chemical can be ingested, or thrown. It can also be processed with a 
special 'chemical processor' that can turn venom into anti-venom or purify a 
substance, making it more potent.
 
Now, I recently thought of an addition to this idea. What if there was either 
a sort of 'dart gun' or a special 'drug bullet' (a kind of hypodermic needle 
bullet for use with a regular gun - said bullet would have much less powder as 
it is designed primarily to be used as a tranquilliser) that could be used to 
inject chemicals into enemies. So the player could use his vial of chemicals 
to make such bullets, meaning that he could inject enemies with poison, 
paralysis fluids, combustible liquids, sleeping solutions (will the player ever be 
able to be 'put to sleep', or just stunned and slowed?).
 
As I said before, the player could also use such chemicals to makes his own 
grenades. Using a flammable liquid he could create his own incendiary grenade, 
using a super-coolant he could create his own freezing grenade, etc. This 
process would probably involve some kind of tool, an idea for which I have 
outlined further below.
 
====================================
GAMEPLAY: Combat - Combat Techniques
====================================
 
I recently had some thoughts about adding 'combat techniques' to Xenocide. 
The idea springs from the thought that certain weapons, like the knife, can be 
used to do just more than one type of attack. Why can't the player choose to 
stab with his knife instead of slashing? (I'm working on the assumption that 
'cuts' refers to slashing...)
 
Stabbing would be less accurate, but it would also do more damage, as opposed 
to slashing, which would be more accurate, but do less damage.
 
Another example would be unarmed combat. The player should probably punch by 
default, by then he should also be able to kick, which would do more damage, 
and have a chance to stun/knock back and enemy. The only problem with kicking 
is that it becomes more difficult in relation to the amount of weight the 
player is carrying / the weight of the armour the player is wearing. Kicking also 
isn't quite as accurate as punching, and it is weaker than most melee (and most 
all ranged) weapons.
 
Most melee weapons would probably have two or three such attacks, plus 
kicking, which should always be available. Other "martial arts" type of techniques 
could be learned, such as "counter" where the player can prepare himself to 
block/dodge the melee attack of another enemy and attack with his own melee 
weapon in the same turn (the draw back being that if he fails to counter or the 
enemy doesn't attack that he's just wasted a turn).
 
Other such techniques for melee combat could include 'target vital point', 
where the player has an increased chance to do a "critical hit", but said attack 
is much weaker if it fails to be critical. And the player could always "aim 
for nerve", an attack that is somewhat weaker but has a chance to stun.
 
I don't know if Jakub would want such a system in the game, and it might be 
more work than it's worth, but still, I think the idea is worth considering :)
 
===============================
NPCs: Properties - Scale System
===============================
 
A scale system that determines the size of an enemy would be highly welcome, 
if you ask me.
 
Something like a scale of 1-100, where 1 is really small (house fly), 100 is 
really huge (t-rex) and 50 is in-between (human). Of course, any creature 
surpassing 80 or so should probably be more than 1 square in size, though small 
enemies could be really long, I suppose.
 
===========================
ITEMS: General - Item Ideas
===========================
 
Well, I had several ideas for new items for use in Xenocide. I'm not sure if 
Jakub will like all of them, but I figured I'd toss them up and let him decide.
 
BIO-SCANNER: A "tricorder" like device that can scan a living enemy and tell 
the player more about the creature's stats, abilities, strengths and 
weaknesses.
 
IMAGING GOGGLES: Such as thermo-imaging and sonar-imaging. These would be 
special items with limited ranges and medium-length batteries that would allow 
the player to see what he normally could not. Other more powerful version, such 
as ADVANCED THERMO-GOGGLES could be implemented, that had longer ranges and 
lower energy consumption. The only draw back to using such a device is that you 
wouldn't be able to see normal light. E.g., in thermo-vision everything would 
probably appear to be different shades of blue, except for certain enemies who 
are warm-blooded, who would appear to be yellow or red. But cold-blooded 
enemies would be virtually invisible to the player, and would most likely be the 
same blue as the floor. Sonic-imaging goggles should probably allow the player 
to see everything (and through walls) but they should have a very limited 
range.
 
BLAST-SHIELD: Similar to the modern shields that riot police carry, 
blast-shields are durable pieces of metal that have a chance to block enemy attacks. 
Such items would probably have been common amongst certain Marines, seeing as 
they provide an extra front of protecting against death. Said shields would also 
have a slot that would support the player's rifle, so such guns could be used 
along with said shields.
 
MULTI-TOOL: Like an advanced version of the repair tool. The multi-tool can 
be used to reassemble old items into new ones. For example, the player has both 
a grenade and a chunk of C-4. Using the multi-tool he crafts (tada!) a C-4 
bomb! The player could also use such a tool to extend the fuse on a grenade, or 
switch a proximity mine to explode upon throwing. Such a tool could also be 
used to repair something...
 
PLAYER FORCE-FIELD: A force-field generator that protects only the player. 
Provides extra protection when activated but should be saved for only when it's 
really needed, because of the shorter lifespan.
 
========================
LEVELS: General - Bosses
========================
 
I was thinking about possible bosses for every level. These would be my 
thoughts:
 
RADIOACTIVE DESERT: Either a giant rock-monster, or a strange creature that 
can control the sands. It would be interesting if it could dive under the sand 
and jump out somewhere else. Or maybe there could be several of them, like the 
sand worms in "Zelda 3".
 
SANDKING'S CASTLE: A "sandking king"?
 
STRANGE RUINS: An Ancient 'guardian' who was left behind to protect the 
Ancient's artefacts from falling into the wrong hands. Maybe this could be a 
'ghost' boss that can pass through walls? That way the player would have to destroy 
the walls to flush out the guardian. Or perhaps the guardian is powered by an 
array of crystals, and you have to find and destroy the crystals to kill the 
boss.
 
MINES: A giant mining machines, with a big drill on one end that the player 
has to run from. The player has to find a way to get behind it and attack it 
where it is vulnerable. It can also use LASERs and missiles, and probably those 
rock-crushing sound-waves.
 
TOXIC WASTES: A living cloud of radiation, or a living puddle of ooze. Or 
something.
                                                       
CAVES: No idea, unless there's a living rock monster... Or maybe a giant 
spider, whose web is the only thing the player can walk on, but the spider can go 
anywhere? And sometimes the player gets stuck in the web...
 
GENOTROID HATCHERY: I am really starting to like the idea of a genotroid 
"queen" that can spawn limitless masses of genotroids.
 
PRISON: The shot-gun totin' warden! Um... Or maybe WARDENBOT or something...
 
CYBER FACTORY: This would be a good place to put that giant computer with the 
force field...
 
ARMOURY: Now this is a good place to have that giant 2 legged robot where we 
can only see his legs...
 
FLOODED CAVES: Perhaps that Poseidonite I came up with would work? Or maybe a 
giant jellyfish or squid who stays put, but tries to use his giant tentacles 
and ink to attack the player?
 
BUNKER: Enemy General, a normal Enemy but much more powerful.
 
TERRAFORMED LEVEL: An Enemy in a giant death-mech?
 
LIVING LEVEL: The level's "brain" (lots of electricity).
 
WARPGATE: Bill Gates, CEO of Micro$oft? :)
 
ENEMY LAB: Um...
 
ENEMY PALACE: The Enemy "Emperor"?
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Well, that's all from me for now. I'll try and respond to the other messages 
soon, and throw a few more ideas into the mix.
 
God Bless,
 
-Steve

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>As I said before, the player could also use such chemicals to makes his own grenades.

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>GAMEPLAY: Combat - Combat Techniques</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>====================================</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>I recently had some thoughts about adding 'combat techniques' to Xenocide. The idea springs from the thought that certain weapons, like the knife, can be used to do just more than one type of attack. Why can't the player choose to stab with his knife instead of slashing? (I'm working on the assumption that 'cuts' refers to slashing...)</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Stabbing would be less accurate, but it would also do more damage, as opposed to slashing, which would be more accurate, but do less damage.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Another example would be unarmed combat. The player should probably punch by default, by then he should also be able to kick, which would do more damage, and have a chance to stun/knock back and enemy. The only problem with kicking is that it becomes more difficult in relation to the amount of weight the player is carrying / the weight of the armour the player is wearing. Kicking also isn't quite as accurate as punching, and it is weaker than most melee (and most all ranged) weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Most melee weapons would probably have two or three such attacks, plus kicking, which should always be available. Other "martial arts" type of techniques could be learned, such as "counter" where the player can prepare himself to block/dodge the melee attack of another enemy and attack with his own melee weapon in the same turn (the draw back being that if he fails to counter or the enemy doesn't attack that he's just wasted a turn).</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Other such techniques for melee combat could include 'target vital point', where the player has an increased chance to do a "critical hit", but said attack is much weaker if it fails to be critical. And the player could always "aim for nerve", an attack that is somewhat weaker but has a chance to stun.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>I don't know if Jakub would want such a system in the game, and it might be more work than it's worth, but still, I think the idea is worth considering :)</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>===============================</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Something like a scale of 1-100, where 1 is really small (house fly), 100 is really huge (t-rex) and 50 is in-between (human).

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Well, I had several ideas for new items for use in Xenocide. I'm not sure if Jakub will like all of them, but I figured I'd toss them up and let him decide.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>BIO-SCANNER: A "tricorder" like device that can scan a living enemy and tell the player more about the creature's stats, abilities, strengths and weaknesses.</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>IMAGING GOGGLES: Such as thermo-imaging and sonar-imaging. These would be special items with limited ranges and medium-length batteries that would allow the player to see what he normally could not. Other more powerful version, such as ADVANCED THERMO-GOGGLES could be implemented, that had longer ranges and lower energy consumption. The only draw back to using such a device is that you wouldn't be able to see normal light. E.g., in thermo-vision everything would probably appear to be different shades of blue, except for certain enemies who are warm-blooded, who would appear to be yellow or red. But cold-blooded enemies would be virtually invisible to the player, and would most likely be the same blue as the floor. Sonic-imaging goggles should probably allow the player to see everything (and through walls) but they should have a very limited range.</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>BLAST-SHIELD: Similar to the modern shields that riot police carry, blast-shields are durable pieces of metal that have a chance to block enemy attacks. Such items would probably have been common amongst certain Marines, seeing as they provide an extra front of protecting against death. Said shields would also have a slot that would support the player's rifle, so such guns could be used along with said shields.</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>MULTI-TOOL: Like an advanced version of the repair tool. The multi-tool can be used to reassemble old items into new ones. For example, the player has both a grenade and a chunk of C-4. Using the multi-tool he crafts (tada!) a C-4 bomb! The player could also use such a tool to extend the fuse on a grenade, or switch a proximity mine to explode upon throwing. Such a tool could also be used to repair something...</SPAN></P>

Ok, wearing more that half of max carrying weight will cause slowness.
The slowness will concern only movement action.

Well... I still have no idea how to force player to go and kill these

of revenge..."

true :)

Well... the Enemy can't find out how to create Gates that can
transport his troops to any place. Because of that he has build an
underground base where he prepares an attack forces and his ultimate

I wonder if someone will read our discussion if the game became
popular ;)
Someone could write really nice description of the game's world basing
on it :)

I like the name too.
And it sound not only like Generic, but like a Genetic Tech too... ;)

This organisation is not all-powerful - there are a few other

Doing "electric status" now and energy weapons I think what should
"electricity" do to robots. I think that it should do damage to CPU
only.
If player wants to have parts, he can destroy CPU.
If he wants to have CPU, he has to destroy body by direct attacks.

And ION Gun would be very useful for Mechanic...

Exploding barrels will be, because they aren't hard to do.
Probably in some places in Mines, and for sure in Enemy Bunker (in
Prison, that will be Enemy Lab too, and some in Cyber Factory..)

Player don't see through the smoke (and gases) if it's dense enough.
Throw the smoke granade and look at the effect.

and I love "Vaults" in roguelikes. You always find "the same" randomly
generated levels and once per 100 games you find strange, well
designed level. I love the supprise. So, Xenocide will have some
Vaults and MiniVaults (some special rooms)

I think that it will be easier if weapon will just have a flag:
"can be used under water" or "can be used in oxygene only"
(what should do ION Gun in methan environment").
And one more thing - if Enemy breath with methan, isn't it a bit too
explosive underground? A mix of oxygene and methan (5-15%) is highly
dangerous... :)
Maybe it would be better if Enemy can bread with oxide of carbon?
Then player wouldn't be able use any fire deeper...

Have you tried to integrate with flying leech? You can get "slowing"

Gaining resistances isn't implemented yet. I have to improve it.

Cowboy Bebop was awesome, if not the best :)

Nope - I was in Dolomites, a mountains where all the clouds stop on

The slowness of Windows version is caused by very poor port of Curses
library under Windows (PDCurses). I think I'll replace it with my own
(or other) library... Then it will fly like a wind.
Having other things to do I put it aside on later...

In my plans Genotroid had to be a "boss" in the Shuttle, but engine
wasn't prepaired to put unique monsters. It is now and I'll change it.
Genotroids generated in 4th level are too tough...

Battery operated.

Yes, unpowered weapons will be just piece of junk. A super-light sabre
or nano-cutting edge will be nothing more than a stick when unpowered.
All the features like a "incendiary" or "armor percing" will be turned
off too.

There will be many ways to get to the bunker:
1. Turn off it's power (searchlights turned on, doors opened, sentry
guns still active) - by shattering power supply on the Rad Desert
2. Sneak by searchlights and get to the Bunker Wall, then use "a wall
crusher" to get in.
3. A long way through flooded caves with additional equipment for
breathing under water.
4. Direct attack at the bunker - the simple way to die :)

You were asking how the damage for range weapons is calculated:

Power = random( weapon->PWR + weapon->ammo.PWR/2 ) + weapon->ammo.PWR*2/3
Mod_power = weapon->PWR + weapon->ammo.PWR)/3

hit_power is Power + Mod_power where Mod_power is decrased by 1 till 0
with distance (means that enemy near you gain Power + Mod_power damage
and enemy away get only Power damage).
Damage is decrased by target->armor.ARM and equal 0 if armor has
ARMOR PERCING feature when bullet doesn't have ARMOR PERCING feature.
If bullet has that feature damage is not decrased by target->armor.ARM

Jakub

Are we talking here about the same game - the one whose Windows version
won't run at acceptable speeds under Windows? ^_^; Of course, speed opti-

actual game itself is more or less finished.

I can only speak for myself, Jakub, but I think I'd feel worse if you
decided to abandon your vision in order to fit in neat ideas just because
we came up with them. Stick to your guns! So many games get released these
days that have no vision at all, just a feature list as long as your arm,
it's about time somebody did it right!

All of them? Wow... we'd better start thinking some up, so we can figure

As part of his starting equipment? That should certainly increase his life

self-recharging?

Equally cool (especially on the earlier levels) if the player can just
sneak past some "sleeping" creatures in order to grab a better gun lying
just beyond them, and then turn around and waste them.

This reminds me. There is something of a problem with the tension of
sneaking past enemies in a Roguelike game that is both turn and tile based.
You see, the tension in a "not being seen" situation comes from anticipating
the moment when the enemy does see you, and the spit hits the fan. But when
all that tells you that this has happened is a previously unmoving monster
taking a one-tile step towards you, that moment is already past: the trans-
ition from "sneaking" to "fighting"  (or possibly "fleeing") feels somehow
too smooth. My suggestion for enhancing this aspect of Xenocide, therefore,
is to add a simple little message (something like "The Claw Rat notices
you!") on the turn when a nearby critter makes its "awareness roll" -
emphasis on "nearby"; not more than, say, half a dozen spaces. Further
away than that and the player probably won't be too concerned whether or
not it notices him.

Isn't it funny how the "alternate way" (in other words, the less obvious,
more advantageous route) translates in Roguelikes (and in so many console
RPGs) into the longer and more difficult one - since that's the way that
earns you more experience, so that you'll be better equipped for wherever
you were going? Anyway, since the Enemy will not be oxygen-breathers, I
suggest (assuming any of this information is ever useful) that they breathe
methane; that their bodies be carbon-based, like Earth life, but made up
of wildly different compounds; and that they be, or have descended from,
a race of burrowing insects - since they seem to be right at home under-
ground!

Well... it's acceptable, of course, though it would have been neat if
hitting an alien over the head with an unpowered hydrospanner (*pok!*) did
different damage than doing the same with a suit of powered armour. Oh, but
doesn't this mean that it makes no difference whether you use an unpowered
weapon or no weapon at all?

Rest assured there will be plenty of suggestions for those unique actions

That would be good. In a pinch, attacks can be differentiated into "accurate
but weak" and "powerful but clumsy", but an extra variable like time delay
adds depth. Still, "attack sequences" would be a useful addition as well.

I'd still prefer the Two-headed Dog to be renamed (perhaps to Orthrus Hound).
I fear that since there are all these dogs running loose throughout the Lab,
if the Lab Boss also has a pet dog, the effect can come across as silly:
"What kind of a kennel was he running here?" But the idea of a "double boss"
is a good one. Maybe we could have another boss enemy somewhere that has
another, weaker (but still horribly dangerous) creature as a pet/assist-
ant/sidekick/whatever.

Hmm! Battery operated, I presume? Will it be there for a specific reason
(will there be, say, non-continuous levels later - ones where every spot
is not necessarily accessible from any other?), or just to give the player
a kick digging his own tunnels (or possibly help against that wall-walking
boss)?

Well Jakub, I have now. And thanks to you, I haven't done much else in
two days than play that game. I must say, it's been a while since I last
experienced such an orgastic blast-fest. I should have known that a game
called "Warning Forever" would be Japanese-made! Though the name does fit
the game well, once you grasp the idea of fighting endless randomly-created
giant "boss ships". Very, very difficult, at least on a computer that is
capable of running it full-speed - lacking the basic prerequisite of most
Japanese shoot'em-ups (the reaction time of a hyperactive fourteen-year-old),
I seem utterly unable to advance past stage 11 or 12 - but highly addictive.

I think there is quite a lot in WF that can be learned for Xenocide. Smoke
trails left by missiles... Multi-stage (and sometimes converging) laser
beams... Moving parts that visibly track the player... Mechanical enemies
that can reconfigure themselves... "Weak spots" in a complex whole that
take attached parts with them when they go... Lots and lots and lots of
secondary explosions when a big mechanism blows... Beams of bright light
emanating from tears in a structure just before it explodes... This last
one is a well-known anime clich, and might or might not work in a Roguelike
- but after seeing those searchlights, I'm optimistic!

Balance is one of the hardest things to achieve and maintain! (Steve and
I, having no coding chores, probably play the most Xenocide, yet I have
very few concrete suggestions on how to improve play balance - beyond "more
experience" and "better guns"!) It doesn't help that so many great things
are still in the works, meaning that not all possibilities can even be
explored at this time.

I certainly know THAT feeling...

Oh... Where'd this week go? This one's going to be way shorter than most
of my replies so far (at least if I put my reply to Jakub's posting in a
separate message), which I'm sure won't break any hearts around here!

So it is. I just can never make up my mind whether it's programmed behaviour
or a target-acquisition glitch. O_o

...Or maybe just "Fire" or "Smoke". (Hopefully, there will later be "floor"
types such as "Sand" and "Ground" - Jakub wouldn't then have to write
separate fire/smoke descriptions for those.)

Well! You have come up with another well-thought-out and in-depth system,
ready for inclusion in the game. I'm not entirely sure myself if this isn't
rather more complicated than Xenocide needs, at this stage at least, but if
Jakub wants to include it, I'm all for it!

Whoops! ^^; And I never once considered the other possibilities for the

What do you have when you've got a lawyer buried neck-deep in sand?
Not enough sand.

And if you ever happen to find yourself in a locked room with an angry
bear, a man-eating tiger, and a lawyer, equipped with a handgun with only
two bullets, what do you do?
Shoot the lawyer. Twice.

Well, then, we can have a puffer fish called a Pin Cushion. The player may
guffaw at first, but will soon choke on it when the needles start flying!

Hey, that's a great idea. Have another type of vision, dependent on equip-
ment, genetic machine use or whatever, that just happens to have the side
effect of exposing this one secret. What else could we have? There could
be an underpressure behind a weak wall that sucks smoke into it (this one
would be great for the Mines, which have naturally occurring smoke in them).
And perhaps a magnetic field, faint but nasty smell, aura of evil or what-
ever, that makes monsters take detours around a particular section of wall.
Hey, these aren't so hard to come up with. ^_^

An actual novel? Wow. I have only ever written short stories, and reading
most of them now make me wince! What's your novel about? (Or is it "art"?
^_^;)

Have you ever wondered where they get all these blue explosions and energy

Yes, absolutely. Kicking should work, if only for the surprise value
(against intelligent opponents at least), and be mostly good only for
knockback purposes. This is why I suggested basing the effect on the
target's Size or Weight attributes - you could send a Claw Rat or Star-
crawler flying with a good kick, while kicking a Black Beetle would probably
only hurt your foot!

> Hmm... What if each weapon had different attacks that one could do with it?

Something aking to the way most modern First-Person Shooters utilise
Primary and Secondary attacks for their weapons? Not necessarily a bad
idea (I've long considered implementing such a system in a game of my own,
one way or another), though it would probably require some rethinking of
the game system and/or interface, at least in the case of automatic weapons
(the typical primary/secondary division for assault rifles and the like
would probably be single shot/burst fire).

This would be fun. Who hasn't wanted to do that ever since seeing "The
Matrix" for the first time? (And who hasn't wished, after watching the
other two Matrix episodes, that he hadn't?)

Well, this one wasn't long, and it wasn't quick, but neither was it very
well considered. (Wait a minute...)

Well... I think I'll stay with experience for killing.
It works well in roguelikes. Maybe player will get some XP for some
unique actions...

The living level will "live" - walls will change their positions, will
move, appear or disappear. They will be able to crush player as well.
In one of my nightmares I was in a place full of great, living roots
that was trying to crash me ;)

Underground - as I said before - will be changed. It was just a test
for dungeon generation algorithm (that has to be improved).
It's still on the scheme, because I have no idea with what to replace
that.

So, some descriptions of places:
Cyber Factory - the place filled mainly with robots.
Armory - as above, with the giant robot at the end. A lot of weapons
and ammo to find.
Prison - where player will find crazy citizens and a lot of Enemy
scientists with useful tools.
Bunker will be main "way", not 4-5 levels long as the other places,
but probably 12 levels deep.
Terraformed halls - an experiment with terraforming the planet. I
still haven't planet what will be there. Maybe at the end the
laboratory with this "Molecular Disruptor Device"?
Warp gate - a gate taken by Enemy from Ancient Ruins deep under
planet surface. Enemy used that to came far behind front of war.
Will be havily defended and the only way to the Enemy Planet.
Ancient Ruins - still haven't decided what to place there.
Radioactive Desert - neverending desert, where player will find
all the time newly generated levels. Some of these levels will be
predefined, like a PowerPlant to support bunker, Enterance to
Shattered Shuttle or Sandkings Castle (I'm not sure if should I put
them...)

Well... It was taken exactly from this movie ;)
I just had no idea what monster to put in Gen Lab, and rabbits are
popular for experiments...

But I want my game to be "serious one".

true.
Budweiser ;)

I don't want to give too many friendly monsters to player.
There are robots, but there are too many problems with friendly
intelligent monsters - all these conversations, orders etc.
Hard to implement and I'll avoid it as far as I can.

Well... Monsters now have only one attack per turn, but Xenocide is
prepaired to give different time to different actions.
Now every action takes the same amount of time.

Orthus can be an unique dog of Mad GenModified Scientist.

Genetic modifications are already dangerous.
It can reduce stats of the player very much (like intelligence).
When I add "required" stats to use weapons/tools/devices it will have
more effect.

He can be 4 tiles large - on the six legs like a spider, every tile
will be "other" monster, able to attack, but all will have the same
hit points value.
He will be able to catch the player and throw him at the wall.
He will be able to split poison too.

It should be fun to watch the fight among Mad Scientist and an army
of robots made by Mechanic. Placing sentry guns, sending walking bombs
etc...

true.

There will be "a wall crusher" at the bottom of mines, a kind of sonic
weapon to destroy walls. And robots. Very powerful, but with very
limited ammo.

I like bosses very much. I've played some japan RPGs, like Final
Fantasy serie or Chrono Trigger - fight with bosses was very
interesting - player had to use different tactic for every one.
Have you seen the "Warning Forever" game? It's a vertical shooter
where on every level you fight only with the boss. A very cool game.

Flamethrower is waiting in queue to implement on pretty high position.
I know, it's to hard to survive later in the game and only Space
Shuttle is well balanced. Beeing honest, to balance it was very hard
task too.
I just have to play my game more. In my new test version I made a
player with skills and items that he has after the shuttle and play
the game from that moment.
And you're right - player has to gain more experience for monsters
in mines and gen lab.

There are sensor mines (proximity mines). Remote detonator could be

It wouldn't be hard to do, but would slow a game (the speed isn't

My intuition has to cut some of your ideas. Well... I have in my mind
vision of the game and how should player feel playing it. Sorry if I
offend you by too many cuts, but I just have to.

Scientist... a generic scientist ;) He will specialise in using
high-tech tools to help him survive and then alien (and maybe
ancient?) technologies.

Bosses will be unique monsters and fighting them will be

the end, and fight will be interesting.

Monsters will have "awareness" variable - now all the monsters that

I code now "Throwers", that can throw/shoot needles and other items,
that "regenerate" in their action slots.

Aliens will breath something other that oxygene. Player will need some
tools to breath in terraformed places or in enemy planet.
Such breathing devices will be useful if player choose different way
to get to the bunker (through the flooded caves)

It's easy. All the turned off items will have DMG, ACC, DEF, ARM etc. = 0
Then only the player strenght is taken to calculate damage.

Bows could be nice. It's easy to give it ammo slot for one missile and

I'll think about it.

It could depend on skills. Monsters can be tough, but not skilled
enough. The same is with range weapons - player will cause critical
hits and an enemy, using the same weapon won't do so much damage.
It's good for game balance.
Of course he will meet a few very skilled opponents.

+ Critical Hits added to "TO DO".
The chance for critical hit can be equal:
(SKILL-10/2)% - so only very skilled monster will be able to cause
critical hits.

Ah, a lot of emails, but it's good.
After a first look - very interesting monster list, throwin weapons
and ideas for bosses. I'll write some answers during the weekend.

Steve - didn't you point out some time ago that now that there are more
than two people, this list actually serves a purpose?

*taps fingers*

Is it just me, or has the conversation mostly involved just two people
recently, anyway?

Alright. That does it. I'm going back to play more ADOM, just so I can
understand all these references better. (I tried it way back when it was
pretty new, couldn't get anything done, and dropped it in disgust.) Anyway,
since we already have several speed-adjusting effects in the game (and no
fatigue system), it seems logical to use the same for this purpose. Just
lower the "SPD" value on the main playing screen (like heavier armour does) -
the "Slow" status is better reserved for temporary effects that can "heal".

> Sorry, got a little carried away there with the l33t speak and whatnot.

Once we have that "l33t c0Mpu73r w1Z@Rd" in the game, you can write the
description. There weren't enough quintuple exclamation marks in the game
anyway... ^_^;

This is a very good point. (And a good example of all the coding difficult-

In fact, that tactic was used in both Predator films, remember? Only Arnie
was quite a bit less sophisticated with his version (using mud and water
instead of a high-tech suit).

While we're being realistic, I just have to point out the problems with
thermal vision, and why so few creatures have it on Earth: actually, it
has to do with the "fire and explosions" point up there. In short, a warm-
blooded creature having thermal vision would have it similar to a creature
with normal vision whose body radiated intense light. Your own body heat
would blind you. Nature's most likely solution would be to put the "heat-
eyes" on stalks. Now *that* would make for a weird-looking alien, huh?

> But, wait a minute, are they made of "living sand"? Oooh... Scary...
>
I seem to remember the Sandkings as more ant-like creatures, with a hive-
mind that made them fairly intelligent together. Anyway, that "living sand"
idea is worth developing, as well. Such a sand-creature would probably look
like Michael Jackson. (I believe it was the end of the "Remember the Time"
video that I'm referring to.) Scary indeed.

Well - Jakub's already done this on more counts than one! Let's see -
this has to be the first Roguelike ever with no money, no food, no secret
doors... And I'm sure that once Xenocide attains worldwide fame, each one
of those points will have people protesting them spiritedly. Everyone
expects different things from Roguelikes, and somebody will be miffed if
anyone dares try create something else than just another ADOM. There is a
balance to be struck here (too): novelty for its own sake will just make
for a hopeless mess, while trying to please everyone's sense of tradition
will leave no room for originality. So far, it seems to me that Jakub's
intuition has served the development process excellently; I'll be happy to
keep providing fuel for that creative engine - and counterpoints to whatever
suggestions are made here! (That's just the way I am: a natural born Devil's
advocate.)

Currently, the Mechanic specialises in the Mechanic and Programming skills,
and the Scientist's only special skill is Alien Science, which has no
applications whatsoever in the part of the game that has been developed so
far. As for the Chemist, I don't know what Jakub thinks of this, but to me,
such "potion-mixing" (especially with fungi thrown in!) smacks of fantasy
games. It would have to be done very carefully in order to feel original
at all.

The way to make that angle work is to include so much more pre-written
"story material" than any single game is ever going to display, that
aspects of the story remain undisclosed even after two or three games.
However, I don't think that the story will be the deciding factor in the
replay value. The story buffs will just hack all the story material out of
the data files or code, and the rest will return to the game if it's fun,
and ignore it otherwise.

Also let's not forget that in a Roguelike game, for every victorious game
there will be dozens that ended badly for the player at some point. In many
of those games he will have seen part of the story. Once he finally gets to
the end, there may not be very many bits he has never encountered, even if
only a few were seen this time.

The fact that they sent a Company Representative (Paul Reiser in one of his
higher-profile, most surprising, and most successful "serious" roles as
Carter Burke) instead of a Brigadier General or Rear Admiral to straighten
the Marines out. There was nothing indirect in THAT approach. ^_^ (And
remember the huge gorillas of power-suited bodyguards that accompanied him!
If those weren't designed by Giger himself, they certainly followed his
style.)

Depending on what one means by "control", this could mean that the corp-

America, Western Europe, and Japan!

The scary thing is that part of the conspiracy theories is almost certainly
true. Only it's buried in so much fluff that nobody takes even the true
bits seriously. I'm constantly reminded of the excellent film "The Usual
Suspects", where Kevin Spacey says about the criminal mastermind Kaiser
Sze, "The greatest trick he ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't
exist."

Mmm! Now this is starting to sound like a real boss enemy! Especially that
bit about changing attack styles once it loses one leg. And there's an
opportunity for tactics here, depending on which style ends up as being the
more dangerous: either concentrate on taking out one leg, then the other,
or divide your fire in an attempt to whittle them both down at about the
same rate. Actually, it just might be better if the "balanced" style were
the more fruitful, as most people would probably try the concentrated
approach first (just think of what would happen to an AT-ST from Star Wars
if it lost a leg!).

For the record, IMO the pile of debris that was the mecha should stretch
from the location of the legs towards the player - to give the impression
of a giant machine having fallen flat on its "face". Maybe place a red-hot
object in the middle - the hot-fusion power plant, from which the shockwave
of flames and pressure then explodes a turn or two later...

(The Jawa pops out from behind the rock, shouts "Yutini!" and brandishes
the DEMP gun...) A long time ago, after encountering my first Sentry Gun
(in an earlier version), I mentioned to Jakub how ridiculously easy it
seemed to run up to the gun, turn the thing off, then strip the gun and
ammo off it (even with practically no Mechanic skill). His counter-argument
was that immobile robots can't do anything about people turning them off,
which is true enough, but possibly unbalancing from a game balance view-
point. If this is a problem, then it's only compounded by the addition of
a gadget that removes the need to even approach the robot!

Alarms are always fun. I have recently been acquainting myself with the
earlier end of the Metal Gear series - how many of us knew that the
acclaimed Metal Gear Solid games are merely the latest incarnations of a
series that began in the late 1980s on the Japanese MSX computer? Anyway,
even those early, relatively low-tech games did a wonderful job of con-
veying the tension of avoiding enemies rather than blasting a path through
them - and rewarding the player for it. (Another old favourite, Sid Meier's
admirably researched Sword of the Samurai, had several "sneak mission"
sequences where you had to worry not only about the guards seeing you,
but also about leaving corpses where another guard might happen by them.)

Maybe, maybe not - if he avoids detection by torching the sentries before
they can raise the alarm, he gets MEGA XP!

Thanks, I kind of figured that out myself. (Though I might not have, had
not Agent J exclaimed in the film Men in Black, "Unlimited technology from
the whole universe, and we cruise 'round in a Ford POS!" Will Smith seemed
to have an affinity for abbreviations in that picture, as he had pointed
out earlier, "NYPD! That means I will Nock Yo Punkass Down." =D)

He shouldn't - that's what smoke grenades are used for in RL. (That and
signalling.) But if Jakub's got a huge coding problem with that, I think
we can live with it! And yes, since the player can be poisoned, there
should definitely be poison gas, too - giving rise to all sorts of
countermeasures: gas masks, filter implants, space suits...

...but well-nigh unfeasible. I mean, they would have to be represented by
a "." character, making them almost impossible to notice - while at the
same time being as large as a single floor tile! And what about when they
hit the player? Does the "@" character light up in red? Ugh... It was
intended more as a humorous suggestion - but if this *could* be made to
work, then all the better!

Well, a lot of most documentaries is speculation - more than you'd think
- and they're still presented as telling the absolute truth. I enjoyed
"Walking with Dinosaurs" particularly because they made some pretty
radical re-evaluations of the "traditional" views of the behaviour and
appearance of dinos. You just have to take everything with a pinch of salt,
I suppose. I remember a column in the Dragon magazine, back when "Jurassic
Park" came out. The writer debated (as an aside) which was the greatest
motion picture of all time - Jurassic Park or Citizen Kane. He pointed out
that Citizen Kane did not have a scene of a lawyer being eaten by a T-
Rex... ^_^

Once again, it's Realism vs. Playability. A "real", living creature
couldn't grow new spines fast enough to fire again in one combat engagement
(its metabolism would have to be so quick that it needed to spend all of
its time eating) - but a single hail of needles wouldn't be likely to be
more than a nuisance to the player. But, hey - I just thought of something.
What if the "alien puffer" was not one big globe, but divided inside into
comparments that can inflate and fire individually? This would give the
creature a degree of directionality - and would save the rest of the
spines to be fired in case the attacker doesn't give up.

The problem: there's a whole lot of wall to every level in Xenocide. It's
going to take a mighty dedicated player to go through it all, just to see
if there are any anomalies. And such a player will quickly grow bored if he
doesn't find anything. (The obvious solution is to include a predetermined
"clue" - "There is a weak wall somewhere in the second level of the Caves"
- which, in turn, often leaves the player with a feeling that he's being
led by the nose!) So, such a secret will most probably be found by accident
- somebody detonated a grenade in just the right place, and the wall came
crumbling down. Is this bad? Not necessarily - but it might reward the
wrong sort of activity. (And very soon, the Web will be full of sites
copying from one another all the "secrets" of Xenocide. Ah, the price of
success...)

The problem: it is standard procedure in Roguelikes to explore every corner,
_especially_ on dark or otherwise not-fully-known levels where you have to
follow every wall to its end in order to be certain that you have seen all
there is to see. And since all levels in Xenocide (so far) fit on one
screen, there's precious little chance of the player overlooking anything,
unless he is determined not to gain all the gear and experience there is to
find. (What the heck is he trying to prove, playing a Roguelike, then?)

Now this is a wonderful idea! Even if this particular bit of techno-babble
never gets used in Xenocide, I'll certainly have a use for it somewhere...

> I'm also assuming that the Enemy doesn't breathe oxygen...).
>
Well, they are alien, aren't they? There's a good chance that they have
developed in a completely different environment. (Methane, ammonia, hydro-
gen chloride and hydrogen fluoride seem to be the most likely atmospheric
choices - in that order.) OTOH, there's also a /very/ good chance that they
DO breathe oxygen: it is relatively common in the universe, and bonds with
both hydrogen and nitrogen, which are even more common. (There is also a
practical reason to have hostile aliens like similar environments to us:
why would two races fight over planets that only one of them can use?) But
just because they breathe oxygen, it doesn't necessarily follow that we can
breathe their atmosphere, or vice versa. They could prefer a completely
different mix of other gasses (like a high concentration of sulfur dioxide
or the abovementioned methane), or a different partial oxygen pressure, or
whatever.

Yeah! Even though, if they are (were) classical Ancients and possessors
of a "sufficiently advanced technology", this will be easy - it can be
anything. Form and function needn't have any connection. Artefacts can be
powered by cosmic radiation. In short, it's magic.

...and my computer works much more slowly when it's "off". Really, a power
tool without power is best used as a club. (Perhaps Jakub should implement
a simple melee attack rule whereby any object used to pound a monster into
submission - including unpowered power tools - does damage according to its
weight? And probably the same when thrown, as well.) Energy requirements
are a great way to limit otherwise powerful equipment - and they add a
further tactical dimension. Do I feed all my power cells to this power-
hungry plasma rifle, or make do with just the vibroblade? Or should I try
to get by without the power armour, and cannibalise it for its cells...

Yeah! He's got the easy job - all he has to do is write a few lines of code

I can tell. O_o; Perhaps you should apply for a job writing action picture
scripts for Hollywood - you would easily outdo the BASIC program they've
got running on the 286 machine now for randomising the elements for every
"new" "plot"...

Indeed - especially since the player can apparently find anything in his
backpack in no time, anyway. Just saddle the bow with a slightly slower
"fire time" (can we do this?) to simulate the fact that you're reaching
into a container for every new arrow. This could work. And let's not forget
the explosive-tipped arrows made famous by Sly "Rambo" Stallone!

> I do think that explosives are kind of dangerous. I mean, are they

Do you want to swing a lightsabre? A handle with a zero-weight blade that
can cut through anything? Nunchaku /are/ dangerous in unskilled hands
(especially to the user's nuts)! But you're right, of course. That was just
the first thing that popped into my mind (that was at all more original
than the electrical taser zappers that have been done a thousand times
before).

How about some material that becomes heavier (denser) through motion? Put
it in the head of a mallet, and you can easily lift the thing, but when
you swing it it'll break through walls. (It'd be dangerous to miss with
that one, though...) Oh, and then there is the ultra-tech version of the
taser: any type of "neuron" weapon that directly assails the nervous system
(instead of just applying electricity to cause your whole body to cramp).

Everybody seems to praise that show, but I never got much into it. It must
be that I was much too impressed by the original film. But that staff
weapon would be fun. Another minor "easter egg" for those who recognise
the weapon from the description!

Neither is kicking them, you know. (And don't forget that switching to your
"Ready" weapon via the "e" command takes no time at all.) But maybe the kick
could have the special effect of sometimes knocking the opponent back (for
example, based on its size or weight)? Thus you would, at least, gain a
moment to recharge your chainsaw, or pop a healing drug, or whatever. A
bayonet attachment could simply enhance the melee qualities of a longarm,
so it should be easy to implement. The kick would need its own command -
though perhaps the "A"ttack command could be redesigned for this purpose?
Many existing Roguelikes have a similar command ("B"ash in Moria/Angband,
etc).

It needn't even be as explicit as "You hit a vital organ" - in my experi-
ence, a bright red "Critical Hit!" is even more evocative (and generic
enough not to exclude amorphous creatures, if we happened to wish them to
be no more dangerous relatively than other monsters). And I do recommend
making the player completely immune, if only to cut back on annoying
"chance deaths". (If it isn't made explicit, the player will never notice
that all the critical strikes happen to his robots and his opponents, and
may even exercise extra caution for fear of taking a critical!)

I'm a bit ambivalent on this. To exaggerate slightly, giving the player who
splices the DNA of a Giant Wasp to his own the ability to fly sounds more
like fantasy (or superhero comics) than any kind of science fiction. But
"internal" changes such as poison, heat or cold resistance/immunity (or
quicker or slower healing) are easier to rationalise, and don't affect
game balance so much. IMHO.
(A friend suggested making the acquisition of "powers" random, so that you
only gain poison immunity from that Stained Worm carcass some of the time.)

I'm going to have to take some of this discussion to a private exchange,
it's gone so far beyond Xenocide that it doesn't really belong on this
list. (Sorry Jakub, I know you must have enjoyed these arguments more than
any soap opera on TV!)

That makes two of us, then. The price you pay for perfectionism is
perfectionism itself. Feel free to quote me. ^_^

To this "email censoring man" I have this to say:
 
"We're onto you, you know. Messing with people's email, it's disgusting, 
really. I know you're out there, somewhere, and I vow this day that I will hunt

:D

Well, Antti, I like your idea about carrying weight and player strength. I am 
reminded of how in ADOM the player can become "burdened", "strained" and 
"very strained". That always seemed to work rather well, and though a system where 
the player gradually loses speed would be good, there should be some way of 
telling said player that his speed had dropped. Perhaps just giving him the 
"slow" status?

Well, I thought that the internal liquids could be corrosive, surrounded by 
an external membrane so it doesn't melt through the floor.
 
BTW, this monster would be good in the mines, methinks.

Yes, such a DNA absorption system probably would be fraught with bugs, but 
think of what the finished, debugged product would be!

Beware the fearsome "Dimensiomorph", whose name I have already added to my

Sorry, got a little carried away there with the l33t speak and whatnot. 
Anyway, on with the show...
 
>Yeah... What effect would this have? Unfazed by smoke... Does smoke affect
>other creature types at all?
 
Effects of thermal vision:
 
* Can see warm blooded (endothermic) enemies regardless of smoke, 
invisibility or lighting level.
 
* Can see through holograms (I doubt holograms would project accurate body 
heat).
 
* If the creature only has thermal vision, then it couldn't see cold-blooded 
(ectothermic) creatures
 
* Fire and explosions can scramble the enemy's vision
 
* A thermal-retentive suit (that conceals the player's body heat) could make 
the player virtually invisible to said creature (similar to the tactic used 
near the end of "Predator 2").
 
>Would
>the holograms then flicker out as soon as they are attacked, just for
>simplicity?
 
Well, my original idea was for a sort of "hologram grenade" that the player 
would activate and then throw. Wherever it lands, it projects a moving hologram 
of the player. The device itself is hard to spot, so most enemies (except the 
really smart ones) would be fooled by it. The hologram would probably have a 
weak magnetic field (similar to this "holo-ghost") that, once overloaded, 
would flicker out of existence. Of course, a hologram device that creates lots and 
lots of one-hit holograms could be very useful, indeed...

Darn. And here I was hoping to dethrone the Sandking, and become the new 
Sandking myself...
 
>(No, I didn't realise either that the Shuttle was in fact in a decaying

I meant to ask Jakub about that, since it had been bombarded with missiles 
and all...
 
And I do think that the sandkings' castle is a great idea, too. I haven't 
read the story, though I will try and find it.
 
But, wait a minute, are they made of "living sand"? Oooh... Scary...

True, true. But I really think that, with Xenocide, Jakub could take 
roguelikes in a whole new direction, while preserving the things about them we all 
know and love. Yes, the player can be mister hack 'n slash if he wants. But I 
think it would be interesting if the player could find lots of alternatives to 
combat (for those players who are too weak to lug around that minigun and 1000 
rounds of ammo). And I think it would be interesting if a scientist class could 
have more uses than just knowing how to use alien guns and whatnot...
 
(A thought: What kind of scientist is the scientist? A technology/computer 
specialist, I suppose. A chemist would make a nice "scientist" class as well. He 
could mix weird formulas and fungi to make serums that could be drunk or 
injected into the player... But maybe the medic should do that.)
 
>No matter how vigorously you apply that tool,
>eventually you're going to have to find something else to do in order to
>gain further insight.
 
Well, my idea would be that once the player becomes proficient in a skill, 
easier tasks (such as hacking into a cleaning bot) don't give xp, while hacking 
into the Enemy's mainframe still would. But once the player become really 
skilled, then it becomes hard for him to gain xp/skill points from hacking.
 
>From this point of view, it's better to place a bare
>minimum of chunks of story firmly in the player's path, and concentrate
>instead on the gameplay.
 
True. That's why I believe the player should have to do lots of work to 
figure out "the whole story". Make it optional. But the player still needs to find 
out enough to (A) Figure out that the Enemy had a warp-gate, (B) Realize he 
has to blow them to hell, and (C) figure out how to use the 
molecular-destabilizer to do this. It's kind of like the story progression in ADOM. "Chaos will 
destroy the world!" "You must kill chaos!" "Here's HOW to destroy chaos!" 
Anything beyond that should be optional, IMHO.

That's a good idea that I never thought of. I had just assumed that the Enemy 
had 'gated' to Tartarus 3 and built their own prototype gate for the return 
trip. I never thought that the ancients would have built a gate on Tartarus, 
but that would explain there presence there! Silly me...

Weyland-Yutani! That's right...
 
I can never remember that name.
 
But anyway, who's to say that they didn't secretly control the Colonial 
Marines, at least indirectly? Perhaps Weyland-Yutani "is much like a cancer, 
constantly metastasising and spreading, corrupting everything it touches", 
controlling the world from the shadows, as it were?
 
Or maybe not :D
 
>The corporation in Xenocide (let's just call it GenTech, okay? It's

GenTech is fine. I like the name, but I wasn't sure about the rest of you...

Well, I don't think it should be "all-powerful", but I think that, on Earth, 
it should control most of Northern America and Western Europe. And probably 
Japan, too...
 
>(Though I must confess I rather liked the conspiracy theory
>possibilities in having GenTech pull the strings of all other companies,
>while maintaining a facade of free competition!)
 
Well, I think that would be a good way for GenTech to bypass anti-trust laws 
(It's a scary thought, though. I don't hate Big Business, but there is a lot 
of potential for corruption, and, if left unchecked, such corporations could 
end up controlling everything...).
 
I am a fan of conspiracy theory fiction, and I wouldn't be surprised if some 
of it were true (not the alien stuff... mostly the assassination attempts and 
what not). Anyway...

The light effects at the bunker were amazing for an ASCII graphics game. 
Kudos to you, Jakub! (Wherever you are...)
 
And an immense wave of slowly spreading fire would be an amazing effect...
 
I think that this giant robot should, after it has one leg destroyed, shift 
itself onto the one leg, and then proceed to hop around, trying to crush the 
player.
 
And when the last leg is destroyed, then you get a message with a more 
prompt, about the robot falling. 1 or 2 turns later, and the robot falls, and 
there's a big hunk of debris where that leg used to be. And then, for the next few 
turns, lots of mini-explosion occur on the battered robot's remains (like 
grenade explosions). And then comes the enormous, slow moving wave of heat, fire 
and pressure...

Well, there can always be more than one type of nanite cloud...
 
But a sort of robot-stunning gun would work. Then you could hack/reprogram a 
robot's system, so it's working for you, instead.

I think that if the player kills an enemy without alerting it to his 
presence, than an xp gain in deserved. Also, there could be certain places in the game 
with powerful "sentry bots". If the bots sight the player, an alarm is 
sounded. The first time the player crosses through this level without setting off an 
alarm or being sighted by an enemy bot, then he gains some xp. Of course, he 
already has the experience of sneaking by the enemies, but not the experience 
of torching them to death...
 
Then again, it might not be such a great idea...

Ah, such memories. And now DOOM 3... Which my POSC-1000 can't run...
 
(POSC-1000 stands for Piece of Sh*t Computer 1000, just to clarify).
 
Anyway...
 
I think poison gas barrels and poison gas clouds are a must, similar to the 
smoke (BTW, should the player really be able to see past smoke clouds? 
Shouldn't they block at least some of his vision, using perhaps a flickering effect?)

LASER dots that work kind of like the searchlights? Interesting...
 
There would probably be some place in said zone that the player could take 
cover... Though not for long. Still, if it's all an open arena then the player 
doesn't stand much of a chance with everything coming at him from all 
directions...

Thank you, thank you! :D

That was kind of corny if you ask me (I saw it on the "Discovery Channel"). I 
mean, a lot of it was speculation (as is most of what has been said about 
dinosaurs) but it was presented in a way that said "this is definitely how it 
happened!" Other than that, I found it rather entertaining (who wouldn't enjoy 
seeing giant CGI rendered dinosaurs tearing the guts out of each other...).
 
>How about "Pin cushion"?
 
Sounds good to me. I'll need to write a description for it...
 
Do you think that it can regenerate it's needles in time, or should it fire 
them only once?

Ah, but I love Easter Eggs. I think that such little surprises, concealed 
throughout the game, are like little rewards for loyal players who thought to 
boldly do what no man has done before. For example, in the caves, a section of 
wall looks just like every other section, but when you look at it, instead of 
saying "a rock wall" (or whatever it's supposed to say) it says "a cracked rock 
wall". The player then proceeds to blast the hell out of it (standard 
procedure for cracked walls), thus revealing a secret passage that leads to a 
sub-level filled with lots of baddies and a nice Ancient artefact. Doing little things 
like this can really make veteran players feel that Xenocide may be filled 
with all kinds of special secrets...
 
Even though there's only one of them! Ha ha! But they'll keep coming back for 
more...
 
>From the first level of the area, the
>upward staircase in the chute takes you to a completely new location...
 
Exactly. Like, for example, a section in the flooded caves where the player 
swims down to, say, the 7th level, and then swims back up a different route 
(the entrance to which is concealed by a completely dark area? And this new route 
is in total darkness, so that the player must rely on his dim light source to 
save him? [it's hard to underwater when it's dark...]), until he's in a 
previously in accessible section of the 1st area level. From there a separate level 
exit leads him down into, say, the "Cave Coral Reef", a well lit maze of 
"Cave Coral", filled with all kinds of weird monsters (e.g. the Coral Crab, which 
looks just like a chunk of coral, so you can't tell it apart from the rest of 
the rock-hard coral). And somewhere in this coral maze is an Ancient artifact 
of some sort that allows the player to breath in any hostile atmosphere 
(scanning what kind of air he requires and then converting the surrounding air on an 
atomic level so that the player can breathe it... probably great also for the 
terraformed halls, where I assume that the player can't breathe, because I'm 
also assuming that the Enemy doesn't breathe oxygen...). Of course, he could 
get any sort of artifact...
 
Speaking of which, some ideas for Ancient alien artefacts should be thought 
up...
 
Hm... Anyway...
 
>(A... "Leviathan"? *yawn*)
 
Or the "Kraken"? Or perhaps the Midgard Serpent...
 
>You mean that our weapons use such advanced materials and technologies
>that all are automatically waterproof? Yeah, why not.
 
Yes, I'd say if we can build molecular nanites and we can built anti-matter 
bombs then we can build water-proof weaponry. Besides, all of these 
conventional firearms would HAVE to have made some improvements over the years.

Like an air bubble than encompasses the player? "The pin cushion burst your

Okay, I know it wouldn't work like that. Let me have my fun :)
 
("WARNING! WARNING! THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING! LIFE SUPPORT FEILD IS ABOUT

I know how efficient "vibro blades" can be. My father is a barber, and he 
owns electric clippers. The blades couldn't cut through anything, until they 
start to vibrate, in which case they cut right through hairs. So a super-sharp 
blade, that was super strong (so it's mono-molecular edge doesn't break right 
off), with microscopic serrations that are constantly vibrating, making it work 
much like a chain-saw...
 
Of course, such weapons would be rare, and would probably require batteries 
to get the "vibro-action" benefit (methinks that power tools should require 
batteries, too. You can still attack with a power-drill if it's switched off, but 
when it's on it does a lot more damage... Your thoughts, Antti [and Jakub, 
whereever you are... The Bahamas, was it? Sunning yourself on the beaches, 
surrounded by the beautiful landscape and the placid ocean and many gorgeous women, 
while we toil and slave away at coming up with ideas for Xenocide... ^_^ ]).

Well, normal knives aren't good for throwing...
 
But throwing knives can be deadly (especially "future tech-knives"), though 
they require strength, skill and dexterity to be used properly. That would 
certainly balance out their strength, especially since they would probably be 
found later in the game...). The player could be a ninja-type that uses a cloaking 
device to conceal his presence and then throws shuriken at his foes from the 
shadows. And when they get too close, he lops their heads of with his 
mono-vibro sword. And let's not forget the crossbow pistol and mini wrist crossbow 
weapons...

Sounds like a good idea for a movie or a book...

A SCENE FROM: OUT FOR BLOOD
 
      There were twelve men in the bar that night, and they were all out for 
blood. My blood. I tried to reason with them, I told them that I didn't want 
any trouble. The thing is, saying that you don't want any trouble to these guys 
would be worse than outright asking for it. But I realised that too late.
      In an instant, where twelve once stood, twelve now lay, lifeless and 
cold, a knife imbedded in each one's head. I was the only man left standing, the 
only one alive. It was the most simple and horrible thing to do, killing all 
those guys. All at once, just like that, dead.
      There was no point in paying the bartender's corpse, so I just turned 
and walked out of the building like nothing had ever happened. But something 
had happened, and I knew it somewhere in the depths of my soul...
 
---
 
Anyway, wasn't that exciting. A ninja-type drops twelve men in an instant. 
How I love writing :)
 
>But then, even without a sound system, if the only
>weapon you have handy is a bow and arrow, then that's what you'll use.
 
True. Besides, a bow has other advantages. Perhaps a traditional bow and 
arrow could be in the game, and the player would never have to reload it...
 
He would still have to be skilled enough to set the arrows, though.
 
>Absolutely! Say, nunchaku embedded with tiny explosive charges. They have
>to be replaced from time to time (reload your 'chucks!), but it delivers an

Well, I had this idea for a melee weapon that can only be used properly by 
skilled players. For every consecutive hit you score on an enemy, the weapon 
gets slightly stronger and moves slightly faster. Perhaps these nunchaku could be 
it? I do think that explosives are kind of dangerous. I mean, are they built 
into the handle? Do you want to blow your hands off?
 
I think electrical taser-type things at either end would be nice. Or 
super-hard knob-like things, that can crush through stone even if swung by a novice...
 
>It was a long-shafted anti-cyborg hammer with some sort of ramjet rocket in 
the
>head (activated by an arc-like attack motion) for that ultrasonic touch.
>Outlandish, certainly, but if we want super-powered melee weapons...
 
I had a thought for a sort of staff weapon similar to the one used on the 
amazingly well done (and hilariously funny) "Stargate SG-1". This weapon would be 
super-hard and super-flexible (different metal woven together like in a 
katana... it's the future, so anything could happen... I'm running out of excuses 
for this miracle substance...). It would attack with considerable force in 
melee, plus it could perform two kind of special attacks. One is where the player 
uses it to execute a melee range jolt attack, the other is where he uses it to 
shoot electricity long range, though this is limited in power and ammo 
because of the weapon's smallish battery...
 
Speaking of melee weapons, what about rifles with vibro-blade (or some kind 
of) bayonets? And shouldn't there be a way to kick enemies who get to close to 
you? I mean, hitting a gun with a pistol isn't going to help much (though a 
rifle butt could... and so could a knife...).
 
>know. This has been bugging me for a long time, but I have pestered Jakub
>about firearm damages for so long that I was too embarrassed to bring it up
>again!
 
More powerful rifles would bring balance to the game, and give the player a 
reason to save his rifle ammo and waste his 9mm pistol ammo via his sub-machine 
gun.
 
>and then there's the fact that rifles CAN be used against the
>player as well, which can make for some distressingly short careers if rifle
>damage values were "realistic".
 
A thought. A crazy miner or a crazy anything shouldn't really be able to aim 
so well with a rifle. In fact, he shouldn't really be able to pick up and use 
a rifle. Crazy people are only allowed to use whatever guns they had BEFORE 
they were crazy. If they had no guns, then they should be limited to large 
blades and power-tools :D
 
Seriously, though, crazy-types shouldn't be able to aim that well. And 
heavier armours would really help the player stay alive longer.
 
>Hey, Jakub! How about implementing a "critical hit" system? Make it some-

You hit a vital organ? It could work, though the more amorphous creatures 
should be immune. The player should probably be immune as well, at least until 
the tougher, more skilled enemies come along.
 
>I noticed that a Flying Leech attacking a robot DOES do
>physical damage - and if I'm not imagining things, quite a lot of it. (My

Now that is weird. Probably a bug...
 
>What about special properties like poison resistance? Clearly, a venomous
>animal is immune to its own poison. If you were to splice its DNA into
>yours, wouldn't you become immune (or at least resistant) to poison as well?
 
Now that's a good idea. The player should probably gain the creatures 
strengths and weaknesses, as well as his powers. So "(player) + (flying leech) = 
(player who is resistant to slowing and can slow enemies through the leech mouths 
on his hands)", or something like that.
 
>(This, of course, is what was achieved by eating corpses in NetHack. I like
>this a lot. It's slightly less morbid, and far more science fiction!)
 
Exactly! Though perhaps more skilled players could pick certain aspects of 
the DNA that they'd like to use on themselves, and forget about the rest. Or 
maybe the item that the good doctor has would let the player do that...

Believe me, I've seen my share of bad television series and films... We have 
this station over here called "UPN". Ugh. Every season they practically have a 
completely new line-up. It's a common joke that all of their shows suck... 
Anyway...

Wow. I wish things were like that over here. I always enjoy seeing well done 
foreign films and serials, though the most we get on TV are badly dubbed 
Japanese anime. Unlike many I know, I prefer subtitles to dubbing myself, because 
dubbing (A) changes a lot of things (watching something w/ subtitles can be a 
very different experience than watching it dubbed, in my experience, because 
lines are different and the actors act different...) (B) makes it so the lips 
move wrong, and (C) are almost always done with horrible voices and bad acting.
 
Strangely enough, my favourite TV show of all time "Cowboy Bebop" (a fairly 
recent animated series out of Japan) is broadcast over here with the English 
dubbing. The strange thing is that the English actors, while decent, don't 
measure up to the Japanese actors (I first watched "Bebop" in English on TV, and 
then bought the DVD of the series, so I've watched both tracks), though most 
people I know prefer the English sound tracks, because it's the language they 
understand, and because that's how they first saw it. Sigh...
 
It's like choosing the vastly inferior flavour of Pepsi over the superior 
flavour of Coca-Cola, just because you had Pepsi first. Ehck...
 
^_^ Enough of my inane rantings...

I know the feeling. While watching Cliffhanger, I half expected him to do 
that "but you have to do it! I ordered you, and I'm the High Commander" kind of 
stuff. It's strange, because Lithgow usually did serious stuff before 3rd rock 
(so I hear), but that's how I look at him, as a bizarre alien who's show that, 
while hilarious, had a horrible ending...
 
Either that or the annoying Lord Farkwad from the movie "Shrek".

I should try and write these emails with a clear mind. Any inconsistencies or 
unfinished thoughts in my writings are due to my perpetual head-ache and my 
current state of being tired.
 
Anyway, have a nice night... Er, uh, day? What's your time zone in Finland, 
anyway? GMT +1? In which case you would be seven hours ahead of me, at GMT -5...
 
Also, I noticed you have a new quote...
 
>Si tu me quieres, trae me la luna
>No solo una parte pero la luna entera
 
It sounds nice, like a poem in Spanish. What does it translate to in my 
barbaric tongue of English?
 
You know, I do write some verse myself. (Oh no! Please don't make me read it! 
I don't wanna!)
 
Not to blatantly promote myself (yeah, right), but here's a sample, three 
quatrains from a long string of quatrains:
 
***
 
Obsidian shadows, crystallized
form a glacier before my eyes.
Wrought of ice, as black as night,
devoid of warmth, devoid of light.
 
Lost within this desolation,
a burning river of devastation,
winds its way throughout my soul,
and my heart cannot be whole.
 
Shades of sorrow, ever gnawing,
on my bones and darkness falling,
steals the breath from out my lungs;
makes dust of eyes and ash of tongues.
 
***
 
Cheery stuff, eh? Not all my work is this dark, though.
 
I know, I know. It's not Poe or Keats, so I won't trouble you with it 
anymore. Though I am always interested in any feedback concerning my works, since I'm 
a vain and prideful fool...
 
Holy crap this email is long! Two days in the making, it was. Too bad I feel 
compelled to respond to every single point...
 
Anyway, God Bless,
 
   -Steve

For example, in the caves, a section of wall looks just like every other section, but when you look at it, instead of saying "a rock wall" (or whatever it's supposed to say) it says "a cracked rock wall". The player then proceeds to blast the hell out of it (standard procedure for cracked walls), thus revealing a secret passage that leads to a sub-level filled with lots of baddies and a nice Ancient artefact.

[it's hard to underwater when it's dark...]), until he's in a previously in accessible section of the 1st area level. From there a separate level exit leads him down into, say, the "Cave Coral Reef", a well lit maze of "Cave Coral", filled with all kinds of weird monsters (e.g. the Coral Crab, which looks just like a chunk of coral, so you can't tell it apart from the rest of the rock-hard coral). And somewhere in this coral maze is an Ancient artifact of some sort that allows the player to breath in any hostile atmosphere (scanning what kind of air he requires and then converting the surrounding air on an atomic level so that the player can breathe it... probably great also for the terraformed halls, where I assume that the player can't breathe, because I'm also assuming that the Enemy doesn't breathe oxygen...).

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New"><SPAN style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>There were twelve men in the bar that night, and they were all out for blood. My blood. I tried to reason with them, I told them that I didn't want any trouble. The thing is, saying that you don't want any trouble to these guys would be worse than outright asking for it. But I realised that too late.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New"><SPAN style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>In an instant, where twelve once stood, twelve now lay, lifeless and cold, a knife imbedded in each one's head. I was the only man left standing, the only one alive. It was the most simple and horrible thing to do, killing all those guys. All at once, just like that, dead.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New"><SPAN style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>There was no point in paying the bartender's corpse, so I just turned and walked out of the building like nothing had ever happened.

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Anyway, wasn't that exciting. A ninja-type drops twelve men in an instant. How I love writing :)</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;But then, even without a sound system, if the only<BR>&gt;weapon you have handy is a bow and arrow, then that's what you'll use.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">True. Besides, a bow has other advantages. Perhaps a traditional bow and arrow could be in the game, and the player would never have to reload it...</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">He would still have to be skilled enough to set the arrows, though.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;Absolutely! Say, nunchaku embedded with tiny explosive charges. They have<BR>&gt;to be replaced from time to time (reload your 'chucks!), but it delivers an<BR>&gt;explosive blow, and skilled users can use the force of the blast to twirl<BR>&gt;the baton around and strike the target at another angle...</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Well, I had this idea for a melee weapon that can only be used properly by skilled players. For every consecutive hit you score on an enemy, the weapon gets slightly stronger and moves slightly faster. Perhaps these nunchaku could be it? I do think that explosives are kind of dangerous. I mean, are they built into the handle? Do you want to blow your hands off?</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">I think electrical taser-type things at either end would be nice. Or super-hard knob-like things, that can crush through stone even if swung by a novice...</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;It was a long-shafted anti-cyborg hammer with some sort of ramjet rocket in the<BR>&gt;head (activated by an arc-like attack motion) for that ultrasonic touch.<BR>&gt;Outlandish, certainly, but if we want super-powered melee weapons...</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">I had a thought for a sort of staff weapon similar to the one used on the amazingly well done (and hilariously funny) "Stargate SG-1". This weapon would be super-hard and super-flexible (different metal woven together like in a katana... it's the future, so anything could happen... I'm running out of excuses for this miracle substance...). It would attack with considerable force in melee, plus it could perform two kind of special attacks. One is where the player uses it to execute a melee range jolt attack, the other is where he uses it to shoot electricity long range, though this is limited in power and ammo because of the weapon's smallish battery...</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Speaking of melee weapons, what about rifles with vibro-blade (or some kind of) bayonets? And shouldn't there be a way to kick enemies who get to close to you? I mean, hitting a gun with a pistol isn't going to help much (though a rifle butt could... and so could a knife...).</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;know. This has been bugging me for a long time, but I have pestered Jakub<BR>&gt;about firearm damages for so long that I was too embarrassed to bring it up<BR>&gt;again!</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">More powerful rifles would bring balance to the game, and give the player a reason to save his rifle ammo and waste his 9mm pistol ammo via his sub-machine gun.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;and then there's the fact that rifles CAN be used against the<BR>&gt;player as well, which can make for some distressingly short careers if rifle<BR>&gt;damage values were "realistic".</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">A thought. A crazy miner or a crazy anything shouldn't really be able to aim so well with a rifle. In fact, he shouldn't really be able to pick up and use a rifle. Crazy people are only allowed to use whatever guns they had BEFORE they were crazy. If they had no guns, then they should be limited to large blades and power-tools :D</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Seriously, though, crazy-types shouldn't be able to aim that well. And heavier armours would really help the player stay alive longer.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;Hey, Jakub! How about implementing a "critical hit" system? Make it some-<BR>&gt;thing simple, like double damage on 5% of all hits, and possibly higher for<BR>&gt;firearms (if we wish to make them comparably more powerful). Maybe make the<BR>&gt;player immune to them, to increase his already-short lifespan... ^_^;</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">You hit a vital organ? It could work, though the more amorphous creatures should be immune. The player should probably be immune as well, at least until the tougher, more skilled enemies come along.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;I noticed that a Flying Leech attacking a robot DOES do<BR>&gt;physical damage - and if I'm not imagining things, quite a lot of it. (My<BR>&gt;combat robot fell to pieces in no time.) Is this intentional?</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Now that is weird. Probably a bug...</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;What about special properties like poison resistance? Clearly, a venomous<BR>&gt;animal is immune to its own poison. If you were to splice its DNA into<BR>&gt;yours, wouldn't you become immune (or at least resistant) to poison as well?</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Now that's a good idea. The player should probably gain the creatures strengths and weaknesses, as well as his powers. So "(player) + (flying leech) = (player who is resistant to slowing and can slow enemies through the leech mouths on his hands)", or something like that.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;(This, of course, is what was achieved by eating corpses in NetHack. I like<BR>&gt;this a lot. It's slightly less morbid, and far more science fiction!)</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Exactly! Though perhaps more skilled players could pick certain aspects of the DNA that they'd like to use on themselves, and forget about the rest. Or maybe the item that the good doctor has would let the player do that...</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;Um... we DO get the occasional foreign show here, you know... O_o; (In fact,<BR>&gt;it seems we have at least three TV channels dedicated to nothing but the<BR>&gt;very worst American serials and films... No offence, of course.)<BR>&gt;I live in North Europe, not Pakistan! (&lt;- MY pathetic attempt at humour...)<BR style="mso-special-character: line-break"><BR style="mso-special-character: line-break"></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Believe me, I've seen my share of bad television series and films... We have this station over here called "UPN". Ugh. Every season they practically have a completely new line-up. It's a common joke that all of their shows suck... Anyway...</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><BR><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;If it was my reference to the original-language phrases that threw you off,<BR>&gt;well, over here we like subtitles much better than dubbing. Really the only<BR>&gt;foreign shows that get dubbed are children's shows (and not all of them),<BR>&gt;and nature documentaries.<BR style="mso-special-character: line-break"><BR style="mso-special-character: line-break"></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Wow. I wish things were like that over here. I always enjoy seeing well done foreign films and serials, though the most we get on TV are badly dubbed Japanese anime. Unlike many I know, I prefer subtitles to dubbing myself, because dubbing (A) changes a lot of things (watching something w/ subtitles can be a very different experience than watching it dubbed, in my experience, because lines are different and the actors act different...) (B) makes it so the lips move wrong, and (C) are almost always done with horrible voices and bad acting.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Strangely enough, my favourite TV show of all time "Cowboy Bebop" (a fairly recent animated series out of Japan) is broadcast over here with the English dubbing. The strange thing is that the English actors, while decent, don't measure up to the Japanese actors (I first watched "Bebop" in English on TV, and then bought the DVD of the series, so I've watched both tracks), though most people I know prefer the English sound tracks, because it's the language they understand, and because that's how they first saw it. Sigh...</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><BR><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;Anyway, "3rd Rock" was chock-full of surprisingly good performances, and IMO<BR>&gt;Lithgow was just perfect for his role as Dr Solomon. After that, it was some-<BR>&gt;what strange to see him e.g. as the villain in "Cliffhanger". I just kept<BR>&gt;expecting him to drop into the "High Commander" routine... &lt;g&gt;</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">I know the feeling. While watching Cliffhanger, I half expected him to do that "but you have to do it! I ordered you, and I'm the High Commander" kind of stuff. It's strange, because Lithgow usually did serious stuff before 3rd rock (so I hear), but that's how I look at him, as a bizarre alien who's show that, while hilarious, had a horrible ending...</FONT></SPAN></P>

That's just it - I'm all too well aware what doubts enter one's mind when
a reply takes longer than usual. Funny enough, this message did make it to
my inbox without any hassle from SpamAssassin or anything. I know: someone
must be censoring all of these emails, except for those that express doubts
about their safe passage - as it's an indication we're on to them... ^_^
OI! YOU! WE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, SO JUST STOP IT, WILLYA?

I have found it a little odd that as long as you stay within the weight
limit (5 kg per point of Strength), you can carry around as much as you
like without any ill effects at all. IMHO, it would be better if your
movement speed was gradually reduced as you grab everything in sight (not
much, necessarily - say, -1 Speed per 10 or 15% of the weight limit - this
is a game, after all). The Speed penalties from certain types of armour
would need to be recalculated, of course, but that shouldn't be too much
of a bother! All this would have the additional "advantage" that in those
situations where you really need some extra speed, you'd start by throwing
away some of the heavier things in your pack - which is what you'd do in
real life!

Hey, thanks. I wanted the creature to be simply liquid, but I hadn't
thought of making the liquid corrosive. Come to think of it, good ol'
Rogue had a monster called the "Aquator" that would reduce your Armour
Class with every hit (no HP damage, though). And so far, we don't have
any equipment stealing/damaging monsters/attacks in Xenocide... This one
could be it. "Composed of an inorganic acid that merely irritates the skin,
its touch corrodes weapons, armour and equipment with alarming speed"...

This is exactly what I had in mind - but it really comes down to how much
complexity Jakub is willing to put up with in the AI he has to program!
That idea about it gaining the strengths (and weaknesses, presumably) of
the DNA it absorbs is intriguing, to say the least... (A living Genetic
Machine!) But, it just might be a little too difficult to implement. Not
to mention the unexpected consequences it might cause.

I'm aware of that - that's why I put "Dimensiomorph" in quotes. (I should
probably drop it altogether - otherwise, we'll soon end up considering it
a "working title" and next thing we know, it's in the final game.)
(--Assuming there will ever be a "final" version of Xenocide.) The question
of antimatter is a tricky one. Basically, since the two opposites annihilate
each other, contact with matter is just as dangerous to antimatter as the
other way around. Furthermore, if the "Dimensiomorph" gets to heal itself
when it's attacked, it might become one tough bugger to put down! (Although
it could make a neat explanation for the damage reduction - "...possesses
the ability to absorb some of the energy released in the violent
reaction...") Then again, if we leave it at "antimatter-like qualities",
effectively we get free licence to do anything!

Like the "HoloDuke" in Duke Nukem 3D? Me like! You could activate it any
number of times, eating up a certain amount of power per activation (perhaps
for as long as it continues to project), and each time it would create
another (stationary-?) copy of you. Monsters would then have to decide
which one to attack... (either simply randomising among the number of
images, or based on just how close the creature is to the hologram). Would
the holograms then flicker out as soon as they are attacked, just for
simplicity?

Damned if you do...
So let's just keep churning out these critters, assigning a "most likely
locale" where one suggests itself, and leave it to Jakub to say when!

I have some information here that he sent me in response to my query about
those very locations. Let's see...

(So it's not "Sandking's Castle" but in fact "Sandkings' Castle". Fooled
me too, that one.)

>
(No, I didn't realise either that the Shuttle was in fact in a decaying
orbit!) I immediately pointed out how fun it would be if the Crash Site
was something more than just a field of debris - if a way could be found
to reuse one or more of the familiar levels from the beginning of the game!
Anyway, as I understand it, there will be some kind of special action poss-
ible somewhere on the Shuttle levels that will release the Sandkings (appar-
ently a collective organism or group consciousness of some description),
which then, after the crash, will proceed to achieve progressively greater
sophistication and eventually build a "sand castle" over the wreck of the
Shuttle.

I trust Jakub will correct the above as needed.

As I mentioned to Jakub, I'm positive that I have read the story ("The
Sandkings", I think it was called) in an anthology many years ago. I just
wish I remembered more than the name - now I cannot seem to find it anywhere.

This seems not unreasonable. (Though I'm sure that Jakub will once again
wish to point out that this is a Roguelike, and in Roguelikes it should be
enough to gain experience from killing monsters!) Of course, there is the
fact that currently (and, I hope, in future versions as well), using a skill
allocates Skill Points towards increasing that skill. Skill Points, in turn,
are analogous to Experience Points and increase at the same rate. This
could, therefore, lead to a "vicious circle" where using a skill tool uses
up some SP, and at the same time gives you some XP - and SP. The answer
would undoubtedly have to be to make the number of SP allocated greater
than the number of XP gained. No matter how vigorously you apply that tool,
eventually you're going to have to find something else to do in order to
gain further insight.

This is what I think, as well. Even so, I cannot but agree when Jakub
points out that the tension and surprise are limited to the first time you
are piecing together the clues! On subsequent replays, there is at best the
stale excitement of tracking down those bits of the story you didn't see
the first time around. From this point of view, it's better to place a bare
minimum of chunks of story firmly in the player's path, and concentrate
instead on the gameplay. Well, it's Jakub's call to make. He certainly
seems to take the term "replay value" very seriously...

I've been mulling over this idea of the warp gate technology being of Ancient
origin (indeed like Stargate...), that the Enemy have been studying for some
time. They had a gate on their own homeworld, but the one of Tartarus 3 was
the only other one they managed to find. Now that they have two examples to
work from, they are devising a way to send troops and materiel, one-way,
even to places where there is no gate (such as... Earth).

Well, Weyland-Yutani Corporation certainly seemed pretty powerful, having
fingers in most interstellar pies there were - but at least the Colonial
Marines were outside their jurisdiction, so they could not be the only game
in town. The corporation in Xenocide (let's just call it GenTech, okay? It's
a fine name, and an original one) shouldn't be all-powerful, either, if only
because such a situation is pretty unlikely! It also stinks of the old
Hollywood plot device "this one individual/organisation is the root of all
evil - beat the stuffing out of them, and all will be hunky dorey once
again"... (Though I must confess I rather liked the conspiracy theory
possibilities in having GenTech pull the strings of all other companies,
while maintaining a facade of free competition!)

That shouldn't be too hard to do... Then again, one should never under-
estimate the ability of sequels to suck! "Alien vs. Predator"? *sigh*
Hollywood really seems to be trying to imitate the Japanese, what with
the recent spate of films based on comics and computer games... Well,
every once in a while, there's bound to be a gem among all the crap...

> I wonder, could the robot, when destroyed, fall on the

Not such a bad idea, actually. What if we could, through subtle hints such
as a lengthening shadow and written messages, make it clear that the robot
is, indeed, falling down, and that it's time to make tracks! (A "countdown
to destruction" with a twist!) After seeing the searchlight beams at the
Bunker Entrance, I'm convinced that it could be made to resemble the slow-
motion running scenes so common in action films!

> For example, a player could use a "reprogramming" grenade to send out a

Ah... a nanocloud grenade! Why didn't I think of that? But wouldn't such a
weapon be better used for direct offence, and make the reprogramming device
something like an EMP scrambler gun that makes them switch targets for a
time (it has to be temporary, because you can use skills to switch them off
and reprogram them for good).

That's the problem, isn't it. It's hard for a computer to decide when a
particular nasty has been "avoided" and should be awarded experience for -
doubly so since you can always go back once you have a better gun and waste
them (so increasing "exploration XP" based on creatures left alive, which
was my first idea, doesn't work either).

Oh, yeah! Was there anything more fun to do in DOOM than blowing up barrels

Sure, but it can still have Mega-Cannon Turrets that track slowly, cruise
missiles that take time to lock on, mortars that have to take several
ranging shots...
("Cruise missiles" intended as a humorous exaggeration. The point here is
that the bigger the gun, the harder it is to hit a man-sized target with it,
and with the appropriate visual cues - laser designator dots, anyone? - this
can be every bit as exciting as having a giant monster run after you!)

Ulp! Okay, got me convinced. That description reminded me a lot of the
excellent BBC series a couple of years back ("Walking with Dinosaurs"),
where they used the latest CGI technology to create "nature documentaries"
about dinosaurs. There was this one aquatic beast that was absolutely huge,
with bladelike teeth to spare. What with the tiger shark analogy, they grow
to some ten to fifteen feet in length - which is plenty big for me! - and
anyway, I've always felt that small and powerful is more impressive than
big and powerful. If I may digress a little (I'm good at it), there was an
interesting sourcebook for Warhammer (Games Workshop's tabletop wargame)
once called Realm of Chaos, filled to the brim with giant demons and such.
There was a caption that read "Not all daemons need to be huge and imposing
- as this interesting human-sized model shows", along with a picture of a
snakelike body... with a big yellow hand for a head... with an eye in the
middle. Another picture had a giant ladybug with pairs of gangly arms and
legs growing from the underside. *shudder*

Sub-levels are great fun (just think of Dungeon Crawl) - though it must be
noted that compared to a typical Roguelike, Xenocide is in fact a great big
collection of "sub-levels", so the distinction would be somewhat hazy.
Furthermore, it's going to be difficult to make anything really "hidden" in
Xenocide, which has no "search" command and no secret doors or such. (The
actions to unlock secrets are likely to become so elaborate that the secrets
become something more akin to "easter eggs" instead.)

BTW, now that I do think of Dungeon Crawl, I'm reminded of the Orcish Mines
- which were a set of natural-looking caverns, with levels often composed
of separate areas that you could not reach until you went down one level,
found another way back up, and hoped it would lead to the other side of that
dividing wall! I found this feature to greatly enhance the "natural" feel
of the Mines, and now I wonder, could such an element be implemented in
Xenocide as well, in the Caves or elsewhere? It could even be used to hide
a "secret": since few of the levels come even close to filling the entire
screen, there could be a vertical "chute" several levels in height, only
accessible from one of the lower levels via a perfectly innocuous staircase,
that takes you up through all the levels you came from (only the chute, a
tiny circular room some four spaces across in the corner of the screen, has
no access to the rest of the level). From the first level of the area, the
upward staircase in the chute takes you to a completely new location...

You mean that our weapons use such advanced materials and technologies
that all are automatically waterproof? Yeah, why not. (Perhaps there was
a period in our future history when humankind had to live in the oceans -
like in the old computer game Archimedean Dynasty - which only ended with
the discovery of the "warp drive" and the migration to the stars? As a
result, most Earthling equipment is waterproof as a matter of course.) This
would certainly make things simple. OTOH, an equally simple but external
solution like a "life-support field generator" or whatever, would provide
an additional twist to the situation... ("LS Field power critically low!
Find a replacement cell, quickly!")

A "mono-vibro"? Whee! There's nothing, technically, to prevent that. Though
it might be "too much of a good thing" and the combination wouldn't really
be all that much better than the individual types on their own... But, it's
good for atmosphere, and just hasn't been done before!

"It can't be done!" They said to him
So he set out to do it
He tried his darnedest to do what "couldn't be done"
And he couldn't bloody do it.

True, true! ^_^ I was merely referring to the most common conception of a
"shuriken"... (My understanding of the kanji that compose the word seems to
translate roughly to "a blade hidden in the palm of a hand", so it needn't
even have anything to do with throwing! Even so, the aerodynamic properties
of the star shape are undeniable.) Well anyway, I have been wondering for
quite some time whether you can use the Knife in Xenocide as a thrown weapon
(and my few experiments have proven futile, as I cannot seem to hit anything
with the blasted things!), so especially if not, your suggestions, Steve,
seem most welcome. Fun ideas, too.

Well, many Roguelikes do have a "Stealth" system of some kind, where a
skill or ability (or simply a random number) determines whether nearby
monsters "activate" when a player performs actions. Something like this
would certainly add to the game (it can get rather tedious after a while
when everything you see is after your blood from the moment you set eyes
on it, until one of you is dead). With such a system come complications,
of course (a cloaking field won't mask gun reports, little can be done to
fool creatures that track by scent, etc), but it would add an extra layer
of tactical decisions. But then, even without a sound system, if the only
weapon you have handy is a bow and arrow, then that's what you'll use.

Absolutely! Say, nunchaku embedded with tiny explosive charges. They have
to be replaced from time to time (reload your 'chucks!), but it delivers an
explosive blow, and skilled users can use the force of the blast to twirl
the baton around and strike the target at another angle... Hey - I just
remembered a melee weapon I saw in the manga "Battle Angel Alita". It was
a long-shafted anti-cyborg hammer with some sort of ramjet rocket in the
head (activated by an arc-like attack motion) for that ultrasonic touch.
Outlandish, certainly, but if we want super-powered melee weapons...

I know. This has been bugging me for a long time, but I have pestered Jakub
about firearm damages for so long that I was too embarrassed to bring it up
again! Rifles are really underpowered - the damage value for a 6.25mm round
is 6, plus another 6 for most rifles (7 for ALL Marine weapons), for a total
of 12 or 13. An 8mm round has a value of 4, with up to 7 added (for the
Seagull pistol), for a total of 11! No, this is not real life, indeed. Of
course, many, many games "compress" reality like this for game balance
purposes, and then there's the fact that rifles CAN be used against the
player as well, which can make for some distressingly short careers if rifle
damage values were "realistic".

We'll have to check this with Jakub, but it seems to me like all damages are
randomised between one and the maximum value. Without going into whether this
is realistic or not, a simple an effective way to make rifles more powerful
without making them the be-all-end-all of the game, would be to raise their
minimum damage. Average damage becomes higher, and even a scratch from a
rifle delivers quite a kick, but heavy handguns can still come close in the
damage of individual shots. (Which is somewhat realistic, since we aren't
going to have hit locations or called shots, so "head shots" have to be
abstracted.)

Hey, Jakub! How about implementing a "critical hit" system? Make it some-
thing simple, like double damage on 5% of all hits, and possibly higher for
firearms (if we wish to make them comparably more powerful). Maybe make the
player immune to them, to increase his already-short lifespan... ^_^;

And while I'm talking to Jakub, I'll have to mention this: Flying Leeches
don't do any HP damage to the player, correct? They just suck away your
speed. (What?) I noticed that a Flying Leech attacking a robot DOES do
physical damage - and if I'm not imagining things, quite a lot of it. (My
combat robot fell to pieces in no time.) Is this intentional?

Another thing... I noticed that when you combine your DNA with that of,
say, a Two-headed dog, your hands transform to claws and your skin to fur,
and your weapon and armour are removed. Is this an effect of the process
that changes your "natural equipment", or is the intention that your clawed
hands can no longer hold a gun? (What a cruel thing would that be to do!)
What about special properties like poison resistance? Clearly, a venomous
animal is immune to its own poison. If you were to splice its DNA into
yours, wouldn't you become immune (or at least resistant) to poison as well?

(This, of course, is what was achieved by eating corpses in NetHack. I like
this a lot. It's slightly less morbid, and far more science fiction!)

> But don't you live in Finland, Antti? Where are you seeing this? (Illegal

Um... we DO get the occasional foreign show here, you know... O_o; (In fact,
it seems we have at least three TV channels dedicated to nothing but the
very worst American serials and films... No offence, of course.)
I live in North Europe, not Pakistan! (<- MY pathetic attempt at humour...)

If it was my reference to the original-language phrases that threw you off,
well, over here we like subtitles much better than dubbing. Really the only
foreign shows that get dubbed are children's shows (and not all of them),
and nature documentaries.

Anyway, "3rd Rock" was chock-full of surprisingly good performances, and IMO
Lithgow was just perfect for his role as Dr Solomon. After that, it was some-
what strange to see him e.g. as the villain in "Cliffhanger". I just kept
expecting him to drop into the "High Commander" routine... <g>

That's alright, no rush. Though I was beginning to wonder if you had gotten 
my email or not, as you were having a problem with that in the past...
 
>Jakub, I have a code-level proposal to make. How about throwing in a

Why not just include a roster of the names of characters that are still 
living for a save system, similar to the way save games are loaded in ADOM?
 
But I do like the idea, since I run Xenocide from DOS myself (Using any DOS 
program in full window mode while running Windows on my computer causes 
everything to freeze up, and the Windows mode of Xenocide runs too slow. Poor me...).
 
And, wow, Antti, those are some interesting monster ideas. Now I'll have to 
try and come up with something equally bizarre...
 
Just a few comments, though.
 
>QUICKSILVER
 
Such a creature could simply spray slime at the player (melee attack), 
corroding his inventory and his flesh.
 
>FUNGOID
 
Enough external heat could cause this organism's liquids to evaporate. That 
would certainly harm it...
 
>RAZOR-BAT
 
I really like this idea. To think that the bat could damage the player just 
by walking by him.
 
>GENETIC MASS
 
It should definitely move somewhat randomly, but it probably lives just to 
assimilate other organisms into itself (thus gaining their DNA and strengths), 
and if it sets its sights on the player (for food) then it should probably 
start moving less randomly.
 
>KIRINI/"DIMENSIOMORPH"
 
"Dimensiomorph" was supposed to be a quasi-comical suggestion, because it 
sounds so corny. Anyway, I like the idea of the antimatter barrier. Could it then 
absorb the energy released by the contact of matter and antimatter, thus 
partially healing itself?
 
>FROSTBITE
 
It should probably have thermal vision, since its so weak against heat.
 
>MACHINE-GHOST
 
This reminds me. I had this idea for a "holographic projector" that the 
player could use to create a lifelike decoy of himself, or at least of another man. 
Of course, you would need to know how to program it, so some skill would be 
necessary.

True, but then we're going to have to find someway to wedge all these thing 
into the game somewhere. Of course, the terraformed halls and the alien ruins 
will probably have strange things floating around them.
 
>But still, more information might be in order... Jakub!!
 
I just want to know about this "Sandking's Castle" and this "Crash Site".

Well, I don't know as if I would build a lab filled with hideous, horrible 
creatures and have it go up, above the ground. Besides, under ground is less 
conspicuous.

Oh, I forgot to mention something! Every time a player successfully uses a 
skill tool, he gains experience. The higher the rate of faliure, then the higher 
the xp gained. Or perhaps the more difficult the task, then the more xp 
gained?
 
>(Perhaps our next task will be to come up

We should make a list of priorities... Or maybe Jakub should tell us what he 
wants us to think up first. I know he wants monsters...

Well, perhaps. I think that it should be somewhat more balanced than that, 
though...
 
>I gather that Jakub is steering away from "a story" in the strictest sense.
 
Well, I think that it's best to drop the player little hints, that he must 
place together himself (like a data-pad found on a dead marine that tells of his 
experiences, or a log entry in a computer). The player will have to figure 
out what's going on with the Enemy, or he won't realize that he has to blow 
their planet up.
 
The way I understand the story so far (besides what is already written) is 
this:
 
This mega-corporation (currently called GenTech, but that can be changed), 
possibly the only corporation in the world (or at least the most powerful, 
perhaps it controls all other corporations, in secret?), has begun to colonise 
distant worlds. Then the war with the Enemy (are we going to give them an actual 
name?) comes along (It would be interesting if this corporation had engineered 
the Enemy to start a war in order to up production... only the Enemy got out 
of control. Or perhaps this corporation still controls the Enemy, and has its 
own secret base on the Enemy home world, meaning that destroying the Enemy 
would, in effect, destroy the corporation?). So this company begins to fight a 
war, losing at first, but eventually turning the tide of battle, until the war is 
at a stand-still, with neither side advancing forward or falling back. Now, 
on Tartarus 3, the Enemy has used a secret warp-gate created from Ancient 
technologies to teleport troops and supplies to the gave underneath the Tartarus 
colony. The Enemy knew of the colonial marine outpost and the genetic 
experiments, and thus sought to test the efficiency of this 'warp-gate warfare by 
eliminating all the humans on the planet. First they set out to terraform the halls 
beneath the planet, and then to build a bunker and a weapon's factory. The 
bunker would be from where they conducted their assault. So the marines, who were 
already dying in the mines and the caves because of the strange creatures 
that dwelt therein, rushed to meet the Enemy when they began their assault (BTW, 
what are the SpaceTroopers? Are they soldiers bred just for combat?) Anyway, 
the ship Atlas arrives just in time to be spotted by the Enemy, who proceeds to 
pummel it with missiles, causing the animal cages to break open. And that's 
how we arrive here, at the beginning of Xenocide.
 
It sounds kind of like the world from the movie 'Alien'. I wonder just how 
powerful the corporation was in that movie, and just how powerful the 
corporation is in Xenocide.
 
Speaking of Alien, there is a new movie coming out here entitled "Alien vs. 
Predator". It looks interesting, though I hope its better than "Alien 3" or 
"Alien: Resurrection". They sucked! :)
 
Anyway, the Enemy is planning to use its warp-gate to leap right to Earth, of 
course (kind of like Star-Gate...).
 
Also, I really like the idea of "rumours". Of course, I do think that certain 
computers should have more info on them, such as the good doctor's journal 
entry in the Lab. I think that if the player really wants to learn the truth of 
what has gone on on Tartarus 3 that he should have to work for the 
information! Make it like a mystery, with the player trying to survive, while attempting 
to figure out what is going on on Tartarus. And then, once he learns of the 
Enemy's designs (Perhaps using a translation device on an Enemy computer?)

I like this idea, a lot.

Yes, that would work. Or "orthrusian hound".

Having varied attack options, and having the monsters know how to use them, 
could add a whole new dimension to roguelikes. Psionic and special attacks 
aside, there are many ways that monsters can attack, from using "Martial Arts" to 
switching between biting and clawing, to throwing the player, or sucking his 
blood (like a vampire) or even just assaulting the player with a series of 
faster, weaker attacks (they attack several time per round but do less damage).

Yes, I remember that. I wonder, could the robot, when destroyed, fall on the 
player, killing him? (no, that would be evil...)
 
>That would be guaranteed to make the audience stand up and go "Wow!" ^_^
>It would need to be an optional way to go about it (brute force should

I have a game on my PC called "Deus Ex". It's a sort of role-playing first 
person shooter, the great thing about it being that there are many, many ways to 
accomplish one mission. If you want to go into the enemy base, guns blazing, 
you can do that, and if you want to use stealth and sneak around, then you can 
do that too.
 
I think that it's best if players can defeat certain enemies through 
in-direct means (though violence must always be an option).
 
For example, a player could use a "reprogramming" grenade to send out a cloud 
of robot-reprogramming nanites, and then set the robot loose on a 
particularly nasty group of enemies. Or the player could use a hologram to distract a 
group of baddies, and sneak by (I wonder how one would gain xp for this...).
 
I also think that certain areas should have lots of kegs filled with toxic 
gasses and highly combustible liquids, so that the player can shoot the drums 
and kill the enemies indirectly.
 
Perhaps levels with lots of robots have special security terminals that the 
player could hack into, thus turning all the robots against the various 
critters roaming the level? But if the player fails at hacking, an alarm goes off, 
and the terminal is locked out. Plus, all the robots on the level begin to move 
toward the player...
 
>Also, if using
>such a tool was a multiple-turn "count command", it would create some
>delightful tension when the player tries to get the field generator hacked
>before he has to run away from the boss-machine itself!
 
I pictured this machine as being a big immobile circle in the middle of a 
level :(
 
So it wouldn't run after the player. But it would have lots of sentry guns 
and missile turrets at its command, and it could release waves of genotroids and 
small robots to attack the player. Plus, it could have one giant energy 
cannon that it charges and occasionally fires at the player.
 
If the player wanted to hack into the force-field generators (which I 
pictured being stationed around the machine) then he would probably have to use his 
own force-field item, or find another way to keep the baddies at bay.
 
Anyway...

It's a good idea. But where could this count down be. Probably in the cyber 
factory, or the genotroid hatchery.

It's always nice to have stronger "standard" enemies, but lots of unique, 
tactically advanced enemies are needed to keep thing interesting. Unfortunately 
these are harder to design...

True, but a wide-pulse will also almost certainly hit. Still, better to save 
this idea for the puffer fish...
 
>If I may be blunt? that's boring. How about giving it a swordfish-like
>"horn" instead? And how about a slightly more evocative name, like "Sabre
>Shark"?
 
Well, this was my idea...
 
"The dark waters of the caves contain many predators, not the least of which 
is the sabre shark. This creature roams about these aquatic caverns, seeking 
to feast upon its next unsuspecting morsel. Though only the size of a large 
tiger shark, this creature is one of the most fearsome you have ever beheld. From 
its mouth protrudes an armoury of teeth, it's jaw extending downward a full 
metre below the rest of its body. Thousands of blades stick out from its skull, 
rows upon rows upon rows of razors, all seemingly sharp as swords, and not 
one shorter than a half a metre in length. You are having a hard time deciding 
which looks more lethal; the metre long fangs that form the overbite, or the 
metre long tusks that form the steely under bite. Either way, you get the 
feeling that you would be wise to keep your distance from this beast."
 
Anyway, that was the idea. A big mouth filled with horrible swords, though I 
think a tiger shark may be too small a comparison.
 
But I'll go with whatever Jakub decides. Though I do like your idea too, 
Antti, and you'll notice that I used the name "sabre shark" in the description. 
Those teeth could easily be made into horns, though. Anyway...
 
>For a name, how about Globefish? Needler globe
 
Either Globefish (which I think is a real fish) or "Needleglobe".

Now I like this idea. And when you see a shell, you don't know if it has 
something inside of it or ont. Do I risk wasting my ammo on what maybe be any 
empty shell?

I one day hope to play the upcoming "Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the

Well, I like little sub-levels in roguelikes. Even if they're just one floor, 
I think they add to the exploration value (especially if the entrances are 
hidden). But they would work fine as "the Genotroids of the Flooded Caves" too.

I loved that show. I still do, too. I especially loved how they made William 
Shatner the Big Giant Head. And who knew John Lithgow could do humour so well? 
But don't you live in Finland, Antti? Where are you seeing this? (Illegal 
satellite receiver is my guess...)
 
>Also, where are the crocodiles? The seals? The... gasp... whales?
 
A kind of super killer-whale would be a nice addtion... Maybe it can charge 
into the player, butting him, and then proceed to devour him?

True, true. But it's better, IMHO, to test play lots of different monsters, 
and then discard the ones that are just too uninteresting or that don't really 
add anything to the game.

Three words. Water poof guns. I think that will satisfy most people's 
curiosity's, and if not, then I'm sure that Jakub would be happy to explain the 
mechanisms of such weapons to the Xenocide players...

What about a "mono-molecular blade" that is also a "vibroblade"? And, or 
course, "light-sabre" type weapons are always much loved.

>lot like a star-shaped grenade, but how about a "mono-shuriken", or a guided/

Well, I was referring to the throwing-knife kind of shurikens (I do believe, 
in fact, that the Japanese word shuriken has more to do with throwing needles 
than throwing stars), though I do have some star designs in mind.
 
The basic shuriken ideas I had were:
 
THROWING KNIFE: A super-sharp, amour piercing throwing knife.
 
ELCETRIC THROWING KNIFE: A throwing knife with a small battery build into it. 
When the knife hits a target, it releases this electricity into it, stunning 
the target and keeping it from screaming in pain. The electricity also does a 
fair amount of damage.
 
EXPLOSIVE THROWING KNIFE: Generally used as a diversion, the blast is smaller 
than a grenade's, though it is a rather powerful weapon, because it can 
penetrate armour as well. It might actually just light the target on fire...
 
THROWING STAR: More powerful than the knife, it can slice right through some 
enemies(maybe).
 
SEEKING THROWING STAR: This weapon has a built in hovering mechanism which 
allows it to change direction in mid flight, following a signal target until its 
battery expires.
 
ELCETRIC SEEKING THROWING STAR: A seeking throwing star that electrocutes its 
target.
 
EXPLOSIVE SEEKING THROWING STAR: A seeking throwing star that explodes on 
contact.
 
THROWING NEEDLE: A very powerful, albeit close range, thrown weapon.
 
POISONED THROWING NEEDLE: A poisonous throwing needle.
 
Of course, these weapons would require the player to have great skill and 
strength. I also thought of a series of enemies that could use such weapons.
 
TECH-ASSASSIN: An assassin bred by the corporation to kill. He has been 
trained in a variety of martial arts, including unarmed combat and the use of melee 
and ranged weapons. He is often outfitted with bio-mechanical implants 
(they're big on cloaking devices) and has all kinds of high-tech-low-tech weapons. 
General equipment includes a "mono-molecular vibro-dagger" and several 
shuriken, as well as some light but powerful armour. He is not easy to kill in any 
sense of the word.
 
ELITE TECH-ASSASSIN: An elite tech-assassin. He's the tech-assassin plus 
plus. He has a wider array of shurikens, other high-tech-low-tech weapons, and he 
sports a "mono-molecular vibro-sword" as opposed to a dagger.
 
ULTRA TECH-ASSASSIN: The ultimate tech assassin, this guy is covered from 
head to tow in a form of light, but super-strong, body armour. He moves like a 
shadow, silent and undetected, killing swiftly and surely. He would probably 
have one of those plasma-swords, or a super "mono-molecular vibro-sword" that is 
even more powerful than the normal mono-molecular vibro-sword sword. He also 
has a cloaking device, and probably some kind of armour gun or shoulder cannon. 
Think "Predator" plus plus.

The biggest advantage that such weapons would have would be their quietness 
in firing. Of course, for that to be beneficial, Jakub would have to implement 
some kind of sound system. I think that player foot steps and gunfire should 
draw monster to him, so that standing still or not firing a weapon would allow 
the player to be harder to detect.

Let's not forget the staff with the taser on one end that can also fire 
electrical pulses through the air. And some kind of super-nunchaku, because you 
must have nunchaku...

I think that there should be, in addition to rocket propelled missiles, 
special missiles that use anti-gravity and magnetic pulses to navigate their way 
through the air. Then missiles could easily make u-turns...

I like this idea. If one saw a rocket coming, he could pop a few of those 
speed-enhancing pills, so that he could outrun the blast in time...

Well, I think that one ammo size for each gun-type would be better. It makes 
things a lot simpler...
 
Plus, Rifles should do more damage. They are much more powerful in reality, 
you know, and that might just provide the game with a bit more balance.

Well, one could set the gun to 1 bullet at a time, if he could learn 
restraint. But...

Really? Well, that astounds me, honestly, because Tolkien's prose was 
amazing, IMHO. But I'm sure it's possible.

Yes, yes. From what little I understand of other languages, I'd say that most 
works would have to be entirely rewritten to fit into another language. Which 
is why I would like to read many works it their original languages.

Well, then, have a nice night (wait, it's night over here, is it day over 
there?). God Bless,

Then the war with the Enemy (are we going to give them an actual name?) comes along (It would be interesting if this corporation had engineered the Enemy to start a war in order to up production... only the Enemy got out of control. Or perhaps this corporation still controls the Enemy, and has its own secret base on the Enemy home world, meaning that destroying the Enemy would, in effect, destroy the corporation?). So this company begins to fight a war, losing at first, but eventually turning the tide of battle, until the war is at a stand-still, with neither side advancing forward or falling back. Now, on Tartarus 3, the Enemy has used a secret warp-gate created from Ancient technologies to teleport troops and supplies to the gave underneath the Tartarus colony. The Enemy knew of the colonial marine outpost and the genetic experiments, and thus sought to test the efficiency of this 'warp-gate warfare by eliminating all the humans on the planet. First they set out to terraform the halls beneath the planet, and then to build a bunker and a weapon's factory. The bunker would be from where they conducted their assault. So the marines, who were already dying in the mines and the caves because of the strange creatures that dwelt therein, rushed to meet the Enemy when they began their assault (BTW, what are the SpaceTroopers? Are they soldiers bred just for combat?) Anyway, the ship Atlas arrives just in time to be spotted by the Enemy, who proceeds to pummel it with missiles, causing the animal cages to break open.

Well, it would have been impossible for me to keep up THAT rate of
correspondence for long, now wouldn't it? Heh... sorry about this...
things have been a bit hectic at my end and all that.

Jakub, I have a code-level proposal to make. How about throwing in a
command-line parameter (for those of us who actually run the DOS version
from DOS) for specifying the character name from outside the game? This
would primarily be of use to those who wish to continue a saved game (and
to cheaters who then build batch files that take the character name as a
parameter, restore it, then after exiting the game "save" the game state
by ZIPping the Save directory!).

Well why didn't you say so. Let me, then, revisit the monster descriptions
I've come up with so far, and explore their combat capabilities... (I'll
also include the original descriptions of those that are new to the list.)

PLASMOID (A floating ball of ionised gas, coruscating with energy. Shifting
pseudopod-like light arcs give the illusion of "walking"): This one should
be slow. If a ranged attack is absolutely necessary, it could shoot streams
of energised plasma, but I'd prefer it to be a melee-only creature. Utterly
impervious to physical weapons, it can only be taken down with beam guns or
explosives (and the latter should have their damage reduced by about 50%,
as any shrapnel is instantly vapourised upon impact).
It would be encountered in similar environments as the Quantum Crawler.

QUICKSILVER (A glistening, vague shape of mobile liquid or jelly, held
together by energised surface tension. Bubbles continually form and dis-
solve within it): Frankly, I'm at something of a loss what to do with this
one. It would probably attack in melee with an enveloping or otherwise
suffocating attack, but other than that... suggestions are welcome...

FUNGOID (An erect mass of slime and vegetable matter, shuffling blindly
forward, attempting to envelop anything that moves within its folds):
Slow, and should have a random element to its movement (instead of heading
directly for the player, might turn 45 degrees to one side). Once in melee
range, quickly envelops and suffocates the player - like a bear hug from
hell. Perhaps damage is automatic after it has hit once, until it or its
victim is dead. It's too damp to take extra fire damage, but cold might
work for the very same reason.

VENUS WOLFTRAP (Otherwise immobile, this carnivorous plant can lash out
with a toothy leaf if it senses movement nearby. A single Wolftrap can
sever a leg; a patch can make short work of an adult human being): A nasty
inhabitant of the Terraformed Halls. Being a plant, this one takes horrendous
damage from heat/energy attacks, while cold only slows it down. Otherwise,
it's fairly big and tough, but sessile, so it can easily be destroyed from
a distance.

TERTEL (Slow-moving, essentially circular, and extremely well-armoured, the
Tertel does possess strong snapping jaws and the ability to snatch stones
from the ground and spit them out with considerable force): The Black Beetle
of the Radioactive Desert. Like it says - slow, heavily armoured, making up
with tenacity what it lacks in finesse. And of course, it has a ranged
attack (which it won't use very often, to simulate the long build-up to the
rock-spitting). It has no particular weaknesses - it's too well adapted to
an extreme environment - it will simply take a lot of time and effort to put
it down.

RAZOR-BAT (A fast flying mammal that haunts subterranean places and attacks
creatures that it sees as dangerous, or potential food, by executing a fly-
by attack with its sharp-edged wings): This one is small, fast, difficult
to hit, but not very strong. It would benefit enormously from an "attack
pattern" wherby it would, indeed, move past the player and attack along the
way.

GENETIC MASS (A mish-mash of random genetic material, mindlessly looking
for life-forms to absorb): Hey look, it's the Abomination. Maybe it moves
randomly (like Bats in Rogue in many other Roguelikes); maybe it can absorb
corpses off the floor (perhaps even other monsters), and maybe it grows
bigger in the process.

ARMOURDILLO (A four-legged animal covered by an impenetrable segmented
armour. It can curl up into a ball, not to protect itself, but to launch
powerful springing attacks): About the size of a Starcrawler, about as fast,
about the same HP - but with a much tougher armour and a "ranged" attack (in
fact, it would best be handled as a "charge" attack that moves the creature
next to the player in one leap and deals extra damage).

? (Looking like nothing so much as a flying face flannel, these creatures
float on the air and travel with the winds, looking for warm-blooded
creatures to land on and suck dry of their blood): Another outdoors critter,
and another that should "latch on" with a successful attack and proceed to
deal constant damage until pried off. For that matter, it should probably
"disarm" the player when it hits, so that the player has to tear it away
barehanded, instead of just shooting it off his face! On the other hand,
it cannot have more than a couple of HP, and no armour. Anyway, since these
guys travel with the wind, perhaps their movement could be in long, direct
lines until they come near to a victim and close in (since they do have
limited steering ability).

? (It looks a lot like an armoured badger standing on its hind legs, with
metallic plates protecting its back, head and joints, and hefty blades re-
inforcing its claws): It can't be natural - now can it? Smaller than the
player, but just as fast, with some armour (not as much as the Armourdillo,
though). Now, badgers are a tough breed, and ferocious to boot. These ones
should follow suit, with plenty of HP and possibly more than one attack.

ROCK MONSTER: Well, like I said, it's big, it's heavy, and it hits hard.
The force field that moves it does not protect it, so ordinary firearms
can crack the stones apart - just expect to use up a lot of ammo. In fact,
it could even speed up the more damage it takes, since sand and pebbles
are lighter to move than rocks...

VOCOMORS: Another slow, clumsy monster, with "average" HP and no armour.
The sonic attack is powerful and long-ranged (and there is theoretically
no limit on how often it can use it), but should realistically lose power
over distance. It also isn't focussed, so it could, perhaps, also injure
other nearby creatures.

PROTOPLASM: It IS formerly human, so it should probably act like one,
using weapons and perhaps even donning armour. However, the viscous and
decentralised nature of its innards give it more HP than usual. I envisage
it as having no head, but this doesn't need to mean that it's stupid or
slow. Preferably the opposite, as it's nice to come up against some smart
enemies now and then.

SKINSTEALER: If we can handle it, these guys could initially be represented
by the letter for another creature, only moving at the Skinstealer's rate
and probably reverting to its natural form once the borrowed skin has taken
some damage and shuffles off. (Realistically, melee weapons and explosives
should be quicker in this than guns, which only leave tiny little holes -
going in, anyway.) Once in melee, it proceeds to unceremoniously batter
the player to death.

GARGANTUAN: Surprisingly fast for its size (and general tree-like appear-
ance), but probably not quite as fast as the player (unencumbered). The
range of the tentacles is not great, perhaps three to five spaces, but if
possible, they should actually pull the player to the Gargantuan. In one
fell swoop, I suppose, since having the movement occur in steps would
require the tentacles to have their own character and so on... (Though it
would be fun to be able to sever the tentacles before you are "reeled in".)

KIRINI/"DIMENSIOMORPH": Speed equal to the player, slightly smaller, re-
spectable but not monstrous HP, and no armour. The real kicker is the fact
that the antimatter-like qualities of its body give it a damage reduction
of maybe 50% for explosions and energy weapons (since the particles and
fragments tend to be annihilated before contact) and 25% for projectile
and melee weapons (as the kinetic energy remains though the bullet/edge is
gone). If we want to be really nasty, it could severly damage attacking
melee weapons and unarmed players! Other than that, it can also attack
simply by touch.

FROSTBITE: My picture of this one is a polar bear-like beast, which would
make it slow-ish but really massive in terms of HP. Heat damage should put
it in immediate flight mode (until it heals back at least one point)! The
"breath weapon" could be a short-ranged one- or two-turn cloud that simply
deals damage, or (if we can handle it) freezes the floor, making movement
difficult. Once it closes in, it attacks mainly with its teeth (hence the
name).

SLITHER: An easy monster, its main strengths are its small size, speed (it
should move fast, but stop to "wonder" every few turns) and poison spit. Not
difficult to kill, only difficult to hit. Attacks with the pincers in melee.

DRAGONWORM: Just like the Slither, only airborne. It should preferably move
with an "attack pattern" that takes it from side to side in a really fast
zig-zag pattern (practically impossible to hit with explosives, in other
words). Even when attacking (it lacks the Slither's spit and claws, but it
has a poisonous bite) it should keep circling the player, say one diagonal
step per turn. A nuisance monster.

MACHINE-GHOST: Well, its capabilities have been discussed at length else-
where, so all I can say is that unless we place the projector physically
on the level somewhere, you should be able to destroy it by overloading the
field, quickly with electrical/energy weapons, more slowly with projectile/
physical weapons. Total immunity to explosives, heat, and cold. Somewhat
weak melee attack with a strong "knockback" effect.

"ELDER THING": Being a scavenger, this one should, I think, be more or less
neutral, happy enough to be left alone and eat corpses. More aggressive
behaviour can be easily rationalised (it takes the mere arrival of the
player to denote him as competition), and/or it could turn on the player
when there are no dead bodies in sight, but when it does attack, it hits
hard. It also moves pretty quickly (slightly faster than the player), and
has a tough hide.

CAVIOMORPH: Will this one really make it into the game? In case it does...
well, it's small, fast, and deadly - the Bloody Rabbit on steroids. Would
it be possible somehow to include high places (ventilation ducts or the like)
in the game from where it (and other things) could surprise the player?

Phew! There.

This is exactly what I meant - about the cats and the bags! All kinds of
things would be good to have, but since you can't have everything, the
question becomes, where to draw the line? Having said that, I just re-
membered that the original Rogue (the pinnacle of Roguelike simplicity)
included one non-combat experience award: the first time you eat a rotten
food ration, you gain one experience point! If that isn't reason enough to
include SOME sort of extraneous rewards (as an "easter egg" if nothing
else), I don't know what is.

In a conversation some time ago, Jakub seemed to mention that the Under-
ground area would be deleted from the final game. And perhaps even better
than trying to come up with ideas for monsters for specific settings, is
to let your imagination run rampant and worry about assigning habitats to
the results later! But still, more information might be in order... Jakub!!
(He's going to hate us once he gets back from his holidays and has to wade
through all of these mails... ^_^;)

I just thought of something... All of the places in the game, so far, are
underground structures of one description or another (even the Shuttle gets
more dangerous towards the bottom). What if the Genetic Lab stood out from
among them and was a traditional building, with the entrance at the bottom
and the tougher level at the top? After all, it's a one-way street - there
are no new exits at the end - and, its entrance is at the north edge of the
City... Jakub, would it be too much of a pain to redesign the levels
slightly to resemble an actual building more, perhaps reusing some of the
Shuttle code? (The old Microprose classic, Covert Action, had beautiful
randomly-created interior floor plans, but I don't know if anybody has
reverse-engineered their algorithm...)

Probably. At the very least, such tools are necessary to make the Medic and
Scientist classes worth playing. (Perhaps our next task will be to come up
with tools that those two could use...) The Scientist is shaping up to
become the "wizard" of Xenocide - useless at the beginning, unbeatable if
he survives to the end (for his knowledge of alien science, which enables
him to use the more powerful Enemy gear).

I gather that Jakub is steering away from "a story" in the strictest sense.
Which I can only sympathise with, given how restricting a pre-written story
is from a gaming viewpoint. (Not to mention the amount of work it would
take!) Even so, I wanted to bring up something that has seen some use in
other Roguelikes: "hints" or "rumours". These would often be whimsical
(such as the immortal "When I die and go to heaven, the first thing I will
see is a high-score board"), but could just as well be used on a more
serious tone to give hints, build atmosphere, and tell a story. In a
science-fiction environment like Xenocide, these "rumours" would probably
be graffiti and such - and possibly, communications gear. I have imagined
a piece of equipment like "a Handcomm" that could be cannibalised for an
almost-spent powercell, or Used (wasting some power) only to get nothing
but static and an eerie silence - but which would occasionally crackle to
life, emitting some random noises, the screams and gunfire of a faraway
battle, or the cry for help or last words of a wounded Marine with a non-
receiving communicator.

Well, I was thinking that the worms inside you would be immature larvae and
therefore harmless (they wouldn't eat an "actual" hive/queen alive, would
they?). It is only when they mature and wriggle out (and land with a *thunk*
O_o) that they start looking for food, and instantly fix on this big, bi-
pedal pile of meat that doesn't smell anything like a Rottworm...

That's a good point (in fact, that's two good points). There's this problem
with naming things - too generic, and you end up with bland names like
[size] Critter or [colour] Mouse; too unique, and the player is confused
when something that sounded like a proper name crops up several times.
Still, I prefer colourful over bland! Perhaps here a satisfactory balance
could be achieved by combining the unique bit with a generic bit, like
"orthrus dog".

Then the other point. So far, all creatures have a single attack, and can
only strike more often if they are sufficiently faster than the player (and
Speed affects everything, from movement to actions). At some point, a
mechanism should definitely be introduced whereby a single action could
incorporate two (or more) attacks, preferably with different descriptions
(like the good old "It claws! It claws! It bites!" routine). Come to think
of it, such a mechanism might even support interesting combinations like
1.5 attacks per action (three strikes per two actions). At the very least,
the bosses would require something like this.

Jakub seemed to mention plans for a giant "mecha" boss that would only be
visible on the screen as a pair of feet. Such an enemy would definitely try
to stomp on the pesky player.

That would be guaranteed to make the audience stand up and go "Wow!" ^_^
It would need to be an optional way to go about it (brute force should
always be an option in a Roguelike!), but like I've told Jakub over and
over, it's always good to include more than one way to do things, whether
it's loading ammo into a gun (shouldn't there be a "Load" command in the
item menu for bullets as well?) or defeating a boss enemy. Also, if using
such a tool was a multiple-turn "count command", it would create some
delightful tension when the player tries to get the field generator hacked
before he has to run away from the boss-machine itself!

Gee, why didn't I think of that? @_@ But then again, the fact that it has
been done so many times just might be an indication that it's a very good
idea. Certainly nothing sets the adrenaline flowing quite like a ticking
clock... Now, if we're going to have a countdown for a finale, I strongly
suggest having another countdown (as unrelated as possible), not quite as
tight, somewhere near the middle of the game. This would act as fore-
shadowing, and remind the player that we do mean business!

Well put! Believability is indeed the key. Now, when you have the advantage
of state-of-the-art graphics and sound, believability is easier to attain
(or at least imitate), by the sheer power of an immersive experience. It's
somewhat trickier when all you have to go on are text, some ASCII graphics
and a few colours; on the other hand, we can use that which top-notch multi-
media tends to suppress... the player's imagination. The player will supply
the "suspension of disbelief" all by himself if we can just stimulate his
imagination, and to do that, a game needs to be, not necessarily realistic,
but internally consistent. If it feels like a whole, it's believable, and
therefore enjoyable.

Probably a stationed garrison (we don't need questions of faster-than-light
communications to get in the way of our total isolation). This would explain
ever so neatly why the gear they left behind gets better the deeper you go:
the more heavily-armed Marines survived the excursion longer!

I asked Jakub about this once, and he said that it would be partly knee-deep,
partly completely submerged. (I'll assume that there will be pressure suits
freely available at some point earlier in the game...) But as long as the
player is "in" the water in any way, any of these critters can pose a real
threat. Now, I'll forgive you for stealing all of the ideas I was planning
to suggest, since many of your ideas are better than mine! ^_^; (I was
delayed in trying to come up with some interesting twists to garden-variety
fish, so maybe I can add something to these, now...)

I'd go for directed, if only for the fact that since the player will be

I like this. Swarms can serve as a powerful reminder that tiny creatures
can be just as dangerous (if not more so) as big, intimidating ones. And of
course, it's pretty comforting to know your attacks are also whittling away
at the monsters' attack strength! Hmm - I suppose a school that's been
damaged to the point of turning and fleeing, would be able to join with
another school and be "healed" enough to come back at you with a vengeance...

If I may be blunt? that's boring. How about giving it a swordfish-like
"horn" instead? And how about a slightly more evocative name, like "Sabre
Shark"? Or maybe swapping Earthly creatures and special abilities around
a little more - for glowing eels and electric sharks, for example? (Okay,
so we do have the electric ray on Earth, but still.)

A good idea, and a creature that has not been used too much in other games
(which is funny, considering how deadly they are in the real world). For a
name, how about Globefish? Needler globe?

What if we could have the shells it uses for protection lying around as

Oh yeah! Great for atmosphere (or should that be "hydrosphere"?), and think

The wonderfully atmospheric old horror-themed FPS, "Blood", had Deep One
clones they called "Gill Beasts". They could (rarely) be encountered on
land, and were fairly strong, but clumsy, enemies. In the water, they were
fast and deadly. (Ugh, I can still hear the attack cries of a pack of them
underwater...) ...Anyway. I wouldn't go as far as an entire sub-level of
these guys, they work just fine as the Genotroids of the Flooded Caves.

I suspect that we'll have poisonous monsters aplenty, so my vote goes to
stunning electric stingers. Another cool creature (I was instantly reminded
of Verne's "40,000 Leagues Under the Sea").

Not such an unlikely creature, considering that ordinary bats already use
the "sonar" principle to navigate.

"Incoming message from the Big Giant Head!" (Anyone ever watched the
priceless sci-fi comedy series Third Rock from the Sun?) Wow, this is a
disturbing one, to say the least. I can't help thinking this would make
one heck of a boss creature for the Flooded Caves.

Hey, let's not forget aquatic dinosaur types. (I suggested dinosaurs as a
creature model to Jakub some time ago, and he found the idea to be fun, and
mentioned the Genetic Lab as a possible location.) There were the Elasmo-
saurus, Ichthyosaurus and the fearsome Tylosaurus. (Their land-based cousins
might include something like the famous Velociraptor, tiny but fast Compso-
gnathus, and the ornery Ankylosaurus. The trick here is inventing suitably
sci-fi names for the familiar faces...) Also, where are the crocodiles? The
seals? The... gasp... whales?

That's certainly a lot. In the middle of this abundance of dangerous
creatures, let's keep in mind that quality tends to count for more than
quantity. I distinctly recall, when playing Xenocide for the very first
times, that I thought that there were quite a lot of different creatures
running around the Shuttle levels. Now that I count 'em, there were exactly
twelve (counting the robots) among five floors. It could easily have made
do with eight. Now, we're nowhere near overflowing with monsters, what with
the perhaps 50-70 levels among 26 named areas, but my point is that it's
better to have "too few" monsters that are all unique in one way or another,
than to have enough creatures to fill any feature list, that are different
in little more than name. So let's keep our wits about us!

> First, what about a sniper rifle type of weapon that is super-accurate at a
> distance, but that can only fire every other turn, because the barrel has to
cool?
>
Heavy sniper rifles (in RL, once again) frequently have low rates of fire
because of their massive recoil (the .50 calibre Barret m82 is a prime
example), and because they have to be carefully braced in order to be fired
accurately. But there are ways around these limitations as well.

> Second, what about guns that can hold more than one kind of ammo?
>
Requires a modification to the interface (a "switch fire modes" key or
whatever), but might be worth it. I have even seen a concept for a rifle
with two magazines - such a weapon could make use of this same function,
and could be a (partial) answer to your earlier request for mixing ammo
types within a magazine: slap in one clip of hollow points and one of armour
piercing, and switch from one to the other at the flick of a switch!

> Third, what about weapon mods, that can be attached to weapon in order to
> upgrade them. Like a LASER sight or a scope to increase accuracy, or a

These might already be upcoming, considering the amount of noise Jakub has
made lately about "adding features to equipment". Recoil dampers in the real
world include muzzle brakes, shock pads and grip adjustment mechanisms, and
in the future could conceivably feature various gyroscopic stabilisers and
anti-gravity devices. Bipods could help accuracy after a stationary period
(for bracing). A thermal-imaging scope could see through smoke.

Hmm... If we're going to go swimming in the Flooded Caves, will we need
weapons that work underwater? Most guns don't, you know (lasers included,
as water refracts light - and that's assuming the electronics survive being
submerged). Or maybe we'll get by with a simple add-on module and some
techno-babble!

> Fourth, what about super-powered low-tech weapons of the future. Like a

>
Fun ideas! The super-sharp sword would, in all likelihood, be either a
"mono-molecular blade" (with the edge sharpened to a thickness of a single
molecule), a "vibroblade" (with a powered edge vibrating thousands of times
a second), or even some sort of energy blade (like a plasmablade held to-
gether by a tubular magnetic field). The explosive shuriken sounds an awful
lot like a star-shaped grenade, but how about a "mono-shuriken", or a guided/
tracking shuriken, or even a "plasma shuriken" with an in-flight created
energy disc? The dart-crossbow is a must, and it could even hold an entire
magazine of the darts (like the ancient Chinese "Chu-ko-nu" repeating cross-
bow). Then there could be a mono-molecular wire whip, or a gauntlet or
knuckle dusters with a built-in taser or monoblade.

> Fifth, what about remote controlled robots or a remote controlled rocket
that
> the player navigates himself?
>
Well, these sorts of things create many problems, the least of which is the
fact that the player won't be able to move while controlling a remote. I
understand that a way to program your own robots is forthcoming, which
would partly cover this. Hey! - perhaps there is a missile type that can
accept a robot CPU module, which you can in turn program to go around a
corner or whatnot.

Speaking of rockets (oh yes - we need a rocket launcher), it would be good
if they were slower than ordinary ranged attacks (which hit effectively
immediately after firing). They would still be fast (and should - realistic-
ally - accelerate all the way), but if there was enough space, you could
see them coming and try to shoot them down (if you were the target), or
sidestep them if you're certain that they are dumb rockets without a
guidance system!

> Sixths, in regards to pistols, I would say that the 8mm should be
eliminated,
> leaving just 9mm ammo and guns. Honestly, I don't know of many 8mm guns.
>
There aren't many today (though there have been a few historically), but
then, this is the future... Still, I was a bit surprised myself by the
decision to have 8mm and 9mm calibre pistols (it does raise the question
how much difference there can be between them - and indeed, the damage for
an 8mm round is +4, and just +5 for the 9mm). A far more "traditional"
distinction would, indeed, have been something like 9mm and 11mm magnum.
However, for a reminder that this is not the modern world, we could retain
the 8mm and change the 9mm into a 10mm magnum (something akin to the
contemporary .41 Action Express).

However, this does not eliminate the slight conceptual problem that there
is just a one-point difference in the damage values of these pistol calibres,
and only another point more for the light rifle round, the 6.25mm. Of course,
the guns themselves have an effect as well, which, unfortunately, only
compounds the problem - the final damage value for a "basic" 8mm handgun
seems to be +9 (assuming the two values are, indeed, added together), and
for a "basic" 6.25mm rifle, +12 (a mere third higher).

But, yes, we do need machine pistols (sub-machine guns) - automatic weapons
in the pistol calibres. What better way to waste all those hard-earned
pistol rounds in one turn?

> And finally, what about timed bombs or explosives? The player sets a fuse,

system?

Absolutely! In a way, this is already implemented - the hand grenades are
one-turn timer-fuse explosives. Perhaps these could all be integrated into
a "modular" system - pick an explosive type and size (grenade-sized or
"satchel charge" - which would be difficult to throw far enough not to hurt
the player), add a fuse (grenade, timer, remote, proximity), activate and
go. Maybe several remote fuses could be left in separate places - a single
"trigger" command would probably detonate them all.

The Rabbit of Caerbannogh! "The most vicious rodent you ever laid eyes on,"

> since poetry and prose, when translated, loses much of its original
greatness,

Well, not necessarily - the Finnish translation of Tolkien's "Lord of the
Rings" is an absolute work of art, very lovingly done, easily as good as
the original. The point is that translation is not an exact science; a
translated work (one that's any good, at any rate) is not a word-for-word
copy of the original in another language, it is a rewritten version. There
is so much more to be considered than mere vocabulary - cultural expect-
ations, the connotations of words and expressions, dialects, styles,
"registers"... Frankly, the only part where translators have it easier
than authors is that they don't have to come up with the plot!

I have quite a few other points to make, but I'll save them for another
mail, this one is big enough as is!

=20
I know THAT feeling, certainly :)

=20
But isn't endless destruction and slaughter the point of Roguelikes? :)
=20
Well, maybe the goal, at least...
=20
But you're right. It would be nice if the player could get rewarded for oth=
er=20
things like using good tactics or figuring out an easier way to defeat=20
certain monsters. That sounds a little difficult to implement, though.
=20
Now, I do think that every time a new area level is reached, the player=20
should gain some experience points. And every time he reaches a completely =
new=20
area, an xp gain should be had as well.
=20
BTW, Jakub, in regard to the certain areas in the game, what exactly did yo=
u=20
have in mind of each one? It would be easier to think of monsters if I knew=
=20
how the caves would be different from the underground. And I hope the "livi=
ng=20
level" isn't what I think it is...
=20
Actually, I DO hope it is what I think it is >:)
=20
Anyway, I think that, in order to make more xp gaining activities, it would=
=20
be best to introduce new skilled tools. Perhaps a small portable hacking to=
ol=20
that would allow the player to hack into enemy computers/robots and even ke=
y=20
card slots (to open locked doors). This would be very useful if there were=
=20
certain area levels where all the robots were hooked up to one computer ter=
minal.=20
If you could hack into the terminal, then you could turn off all the robots=
, or=20
make them friendly, or blow them up...
=20
Of course, said hacking device would require skill to use. The more skill=20
then the less turns it would take to hack, the stronger systems you could h=
ack=20
into, and the less likely you would be to trip an alarm.
=20

=20
The Bloody Rabbit reminded me of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail". There w=

a killer rabbit in that movie, too...
=20

=20
True, true. Especially since, if we add in things from other sources, then =
it=20
subtracts from Xenocide's overall uniqueness. If we add in light-sabres and=
=20
Klingons and whatnot, then the game gets a more "Zangbandish" or "NetHackis=
h"=20
feeling, which I don't think is what Jakub is shooting for.
=20

=20
Well, I usually quickly read through messages, but I'm always on the lookou=
t=20
for anything out of the ordinary (comes from playing ADoM too much, where=20
messages can say a lot about the kind of level you're on, or the kind of mo=
nsters=20
you face...)
=20
And, yes, colours can help a great deal. They can really catch the eye if=20
they are different enough from most messages. But I think that messages are=
 best=20
used to advance the story, or describe what the player is seeing like in AD=
oM=20
when you first enter the Dwarven City.
=20
>Ohh, you have a sick mind. +_+

=20
That would pretty much seal the player's fate. An army of worms inside of=20
you, trying to kill you, doesn't give you much chance for survival.
=20
What if you gained the special ability to generate rottworms, using a certa=
in=20
percentage of your max hp which would regenerate very slowly over time=20
(similar to how the necromancer in ADoM uses mana to raise the dead)? Just =
a thought.
=20
>So it seems - Orthrus, brother of Cerberus. Why not rename the Two-headed
>Dog "Orthrus", then? (Jakub?) That'll please the mythology buffs! (And
>astonish the rest.)
=20
Orthrus would be a good name, but it makes the animal sound more like a=20
unique. BTW, if the two headed dog has two heads, shouldn't it attack twice=
 with=20
two weaker attacks?
=20
>A very good idea. Maybe the beneficial effects degrade every single time
>the player uses the Genetic Machine.
=20
And the player could stand a chance of becoming an "abomination" himself. O=
f=20
course, the machine would warn him: "DANGER: Integrating any more DNA with=
=20
your own at this point could cause you sever, irreparable harm, and possibl=
y=20
result in your death. Do you wish to continue?"
=20
Something like that.
=20
>Yeah, a good point. It's quite enough for a lowly Claw Rat to have but one
>attack, but with "bosses" one should always go all-out for making them
>memorable, and different attack descriptions and effects are a simple way
>to do that.
=20
What if this doctor could cough up several blobs of mucous, which then=20
proceed to come to life and attack the player. Perhaps he could also stomp =
on the=20
ground, possibly stunning the player from the ensuing shock, and maybe even=
=20
causing some of the ceiling to fall down. Hm...
=20
I'm beginning to wonder if this guy should be four tiles large. That way=20
there could be small tunnels that the player could run into for cover... Bu=
t the=20
doctor could always generate more of those blob things to kill the player.
=20
It would be interesting if he could jump into the air and try to crush the=
=20
player while landing... But maybe we should save that for another boss.
=20
>A random thought: if we're going to have "Dr William Birkin's evil twin"
>at the end of the Genetic Lab, why not leave obnoxious clues like signing
>the ravings on the Genetic Machine "W.B."? ^_^
=20
Sounds like a plan :)

>Hear, hear!
=20
Maybe the player could use the above mentioned hacking tool instead of guns=
=20
or bombs to take out the generators?
=20

>>
>With an on-screen digital timer counting down the turns! (Well, we will

=20
Actually, that's probably better for the end of the game, where the player=
=20
uses the molecular destabiliser to blow up the enemy homeworld. The player =
would=20
have to get back to the warp gate, and close it behind himself, to avoid=20
being destroyed in the blast.
=20
>Rubber bullets don't seem very
>useful in a kill-or-be-killed game, but if they're the only type on hand,
>it'll be better than waiting for them to come and get you...
=20
Well, the idea would be that the rubber bullets stun the enemy for a limite=
d=20
time, and don't do much (if any) damage. It's true that rubber bullets can=
=20
kill people in real life, but this isn't real life, it's a game.
=20
>I gather that a "fire" bullet like that could be created by filling a cavi=
ty=20
in the bullet
>with magnesium oxide, but I'm no physicist.
=20
Well, I came to a bit of a realization the other day. What we shoot for whe=
n=20
creating a fictional world isn't "realism" as much as "believability". In a=
=20
world filled with magic, people shooting fireballs at each other is believa=
ble,=20
because of the magic. In Xenocide we make anything that we want, so long as=
 it=20
is believable. And since technology is so advanced in the future, we can ju=
st=20
about explain away anything as "it's so advanced that it doesn't resemble=20
anything that we have now". And that can make it quite believable.
=20
>I've also long had this idea of calling such an incendiary
>round a "Flashpoint bullet", and (given that the

>this as a proposed name.
=20
It sounds ok to me. Jakub?...
=20
>Or perhaps the Atlas wasn't the first ship to arrive... Oh, those poor,
>poor Colonial Marines, they never knew what hit them!
=20
So the Colonial Marines were called in before the player arrived? Or maybe=
=20
they were already stationed there to protect the company's experiments? So =
when=20
the Enemy attacked from underground, the Marines rushed down to try and sto=
p=20
them... Only they failed miserably?
=20
>One factor has to be that way, way more Lovecraft has been translated into
>Finnish, than Derleth. (I prefer to read books in the original language
>whenever possible, but I belong to the vocal minority!)
=20
Well, I wish I could read/speak more than just English. I know a little bit=
=20
of other languages, but not enough to say anything intelligible. It's too b=
ad,=20
since poetry and prose, when translated, loses much of its original greatne=
ss,=20
or so I hear and so it seems...
=20
Anyway...
=20
I think you're right, Antti, about needing more xp. Either that or needing=
=20
less to advance in level. Or perhaps the enemies could just be a tad weaker=
, or=20
the armours a bit stronger? Of course, a flame thrower would help...
=20
Oh, I do have some more monster ideas, this time for the underwater caves.=
=20
Now, I wrote under the assumption that the flooded caves would be pitch bla=
ck,=20
without any light at all, simply because they're under water caves. So...
=20
ELECTRIC EEL: Yes, yes, I know. Clich=E9, but it works. Either the eel woul=
d be=20
able to shoot a directed electrical pulse, or able to fire off a generalise=
d,=20
weaker electric pulse, or maybe both. Also, if the player attacks it in mel=
ee=20
combat, then he gets shocked.
=20
PIRANHA SCHOOL: I had this idea for "swarms" of monsters, where many monste=
rs=20
can occupy one tile at once. Basically, each monster in the swarm acts as a=
=20
hit point, the more monsters, the more hit points. But there's more. The mo=
re=20
monsters there are in a swarm, the higher the attacking power, because they=
 all=20
attack at once. Consequently, they're easier to kill when grouped together,=
=20
but it's easier for them to kill you. Conversely, the smaller the swarm, th=
e=20
harder it is to hit, but the weaker its attacking power. Plus, smaller swar=
ms=20
are less courageous than large ones, and they will often run away when atta=
cked.
=20
Now, the swarm's most powerful ability would be to combine with other small=
er=20
swarms to make larger ones, and to break apart into smaller swarms to eithe=
r=20
escape an enemy or to surround him. Of course, there is a max swarm size li=
mit=20
for each creature, meaning that only so many piranhas can combine into one=
=20
school. So you won't run into "A school of 1,672 piranhas" or anything like=
=20
that. Anyway...
=20
SWORD SHARK: The sword shark is a shark with sword like teeth, perfect for=
=20
cutting through both armours and players alike.
=20
PUFFER FISH: Well, a new name is in order, but it's the same principal. The=
=20
puffer fish can puff up, not taking up any more tiles, but arming itself to=
=20
attack. Then, after its puffed itself up to its maximum size, it snaps back=
 to=20
normal, releasing a wave of deadly puffer-fish needles in the process. Thes=
e=20
needles don't do much damage, but they are poisonous, and they do shoot out=
 in=20
all directions, meaning that this monster can poison players from a distanc=
e=20
with some guarantee of success.
=20
SNAIL OR HERMIT CRAB TYPE MONSTER: Such a creative name, eh? The idea is th=
at=20
a certain monster can retreat inside of its shell, where it is virtually=20
invulnerable. It only comes out when it wants to attack, or move. This woul=
d=20
probably result in it changing colours when its in its shell and when its n=
ot. The=20
basic idea is that, when its in its shell, it becomes almost like a wall,=20
virtually invincible except to explosives and armour piercing rounds. But i=
f it=20
wants to move, or attack, it has to come out of its shell.
=20
Hm... Maybe it goes into its shell whenever the player draws near, meaning=
=20
that you have to kill it from a distance. Only it can attack your mind with=
 its=20
psychic powers! Or something like that...
=20
GLOW FISH: As I said, I assumed that these caves were dark, hence the glow=
=20
fish. The glow fish provides lots of light to a section of the caves. Ideal=
ly it=20
would be possible to navigate the caves using only the light of these glow=
=20
fish. They are not hostile, but if they end up killed, you're left in the d=
ark,=20
unless you have a light...
=20
SQUID: It can entangle the player in its tentacles, keeping him from runnin=
g=20
away. Maybe it could shoot ink, too, which is like smoke under water?
=20
MERR-THING: A bizarre creature that resembles a cross between a man and a=20
fish. Yes, yes, it's a "Deep One". They can often be found hunting in packs=
, and=20
are capable of taking in a mouthful of water, which they pressurize inside =
of=20
them and spit at an enemy like a bullet. They might also carry some kind of=
=20
spear or alien ranged weapon (a harpoon gun, like "Predator", that can pin=
=20
enemies against walls?). Perhaps there is a small area that branches off of=
 the=20
underwater caves, just two or three levels deep, that leads to "The City of=
 the=20
Merr-Things", where you get to fight "N'daog", King of the Merr-Things. May=
be=20
he has an Ancient relic that looks an awful lot like a trident, and when yo=
u=20
kill him you get to keep it? Perhaps it allows the player to use certain=20
abilities, such as detecting monsters or attacking their minds? But, of cou=
rse, there=20
would be long delays between uses, when the trident has to recharge itself.=
..
=20
SEA-STALLION: Like the sea horses of earth, only much larger and more=20
powerful. They are a pretty well balanced enemy, their biggest advantage ag=
ainst the=20
player is that they are often ridden by the Merr-Things as humans ride hors=
es.=20
So, beware.
=20
WOLF-SHARK: A strange kind of social shark, these beings hunt in packs. Whi=
le=20
not as powerful as the sword-shark, their numbers and tactics make them far=
=20
more deadly.
=20
AQUA-TOAD: A toad that dwells underwater all its life, it can launch its=20
tongue to attack its enemies, and possibly drag them in closer to it, where=
 it can=20
attempt to swallow them whole (if they're small enough, and the player=20
certainly isn't).
=20
WATER-WALKER: A rather jelly-fish like creature, the water-walker flickers =
in=20
and out of visibility. Only at very close ranges and under very bright ligh=
ts=20
can the creature be seen with any regularity. While not that strong, it can=
=20
poison and/or stun the player with its stingers, making it a rather difficu=
lt=20
enemy (especially if it uses hit and run tactics).
=20
EMPEROR CRAB: Like the king-crabs back on earth, only much, much large, the=
=20
emperor-crab is a pretty standard enemy with a tough shell to protect it. O=
nly=20
its not that slow, either.
=20
SEA-BAT: (Not to be confused with Ganymede Sea-Rats, which are quite=20
delicious, or so I hear) This creature is a mammal that swims instead of fl=
ying (much=20
like a penguin). It moves fast under water, which is its biggest advantage.=
 It=20
can also navigate by radar, so it can see invisible things. It's too large =
to=20
travel in a swarm, though.
=20
POSEIDONITE: The most fearsome creature in the underwater caves, so called=
=20
because of its strange appearance. It vaguely resembles a floating human he=
ad=20
covered in green scales, sporting a long, hoary beard. Why this creature is=
 so=20
feared is pretty obvious; It has phenomenal psychic powers, (assuming that=
=20
Jakub's ban on psionics was just for the player and not the monsters), and =
can use=20
these to cause great damage to the player, as well as regenerate its own=20
wounds almost instantly. Possible psionic powers include stunning the playe=
r,=20
harming him, controlling him (making him walk toward the Poseidonite), heal=
ing=20
itself and calling other monsters to its aide. Yeah, its tough, I know. Ver=
y=20
rare. Of course, players with higher intelligence scores could resist the p=
sionic=20
attacks.
=20
Well, that's all the monsters... For now, at least.
=20
I do have some more thoughts on weapons and weapon mods, though.
=20
First, what about a sniper rifle type of weapon that is super-accurate at a=
=20
distance, but that can only fire every other turn, because the barrel has t=
o=20
cool? Of course, a coolant cycling system built into the gun would reduce t=
he=20
amount of heat in the barrel...
=20
Second, what about guns that can hold more than one kind of ammo? Like how=
=20
some rifles have a built in grenade launcher, or a huge gun that can go bac=
k and=20
forth from rifle, to grenade launcher, to flamethrower.
=20
Third, what about weapon mods, that can be attached to weapon in order to=20
upgrade them. Like a LASER sight or a scope to increase accuracy, or a "har=
monic=20
stabilizer" to reduce recoil, or a small grenade launcher that can be attac=
hed=20
to a rifle, or maybe even a sound suppresser (often wrongfully called=20
silencers), if enemies will be able to hear gunfire and follow it to its so=
urce.
=20
Fourth, what about super-powered low-tech weapons of the future. Like a swo=
rd=20
with a super-sharp blade that can cut through most anything, or=20
ninja-shuriken with explosives built into them. And maybe a mini-cross bow =
that shoots=20
poison-darts?
=20
Fifth, what about remote controlled robots or a remote controlled rocket th=
at=20
the player navigates himself? Of course, the player wouldn't be able to mov=
e=20
while controlling such a weapon.
=20
Sixths, in regards to pistols, I would say that the 8mm should be eliminate=
d,=20
leaving just 9mm ammo and guns. Honestly, I don't know of many 8mm guns. Pl=
us=20
Xenocide could have something similar to the Ruger MP9 submachine gun. Of=20
course, there should still be a second type of pistol ammo, probably for a =
.45=20
magnum. Much more powerful, but nowhere near as accurate in the hands of a=
=20
novice.
=20
And finally, what about timed bombs or explosives? The player sets a fuse,=
=20
and after that time is up, the bomb blows. Or maybe a remote-detonation sys=
tem?
=20
Anyway, that's all from me, for now. God bless,
=20

attacking power, because they all attack at once. Consequently, they're eas=
ier to kill when grouped together, but it's easier for them to kill you. Co=
nversely, the smaller the swarm, the harder it is to hit, but the weaker it=

Ohhh... That's what you get for typing faster than you can think. In my
suggestion about "exploration experience", I neglected to include the
most important point: that it would be an award for reaching a never-
before-visited "dungeon" level. This would make advancing for its own
sake somewhat worthwhile. I'm aware that Jakub is against adding extraneous
experience awards to an otherwise straightforward game (and it's true that
once THAT cat is out of the proverbial bag, people are likely to want all
kinds of "story awards"), but it's so nice sometimes to be commended for
something else besides endless destruction and slaughter.

> Yes, Templars could work, but many roguelikes plagiarize.

Sure, but that's no reason for us to do so! @_@ The problem with using
other people's ideas (in freeware Roguelike titles) isn't so much the
fear of being sued, but the player's reaction to seeing something familiar.
So far, Xenocide has admirably avoided the sort of tongue-in-cheek humour
that is so common in other games (and that would fit in rather badly in
our science-horror romp - okay, so the Bloody Rabbit does push it a
little). I'd much rather see almost-familiar names and descriptions that
leave those players who do know the object of plagiarism wondering whether
that was pure coincidence, than to flat-out announce "Look, we've got
Wookiees in our game." In my mind, it's always better to leave 'em guessing.

So do I (sometimes), and now that there is a viewable message buffer,
messages do have somewhat more value than without it. Also, using differing
colours helps focus the player's attention to where there is something else
to see than "N points of damage, it died."

You know, all walls ARE destructible, only it would take more ammo than
one is likely to find in the entire game to dig holes of any size with
your gun...
...Which only means that the above "boss" would be a great idea, especially
if coupled with somewhat weaker walls than usual. (And perhaps a smallish
room with not too many walls!) You'd have to waste some time and ammunition
just to limit the monster's hiding places, but it would pay off in the end
by making the otherwise nigh-impossible "boss" more easily defeatable.

Ohh, you have a sick mind. +_+ Yes, the worms *could* be friendly... but
then, Xenocide isn't all that big on friendly monsters (not yet, anyway)...
Also, it would bring across the "icky factor" even better if these things
crawling around inside you are ALSO out to get you!

Reading "The Divine Comedy" still sits firmly in the "to do" department,
and I found "Paradise Lost" mostly useful for insights into Lucifer's (as
well as certain other otherworldly beings) way of thinking. But, thanks
anyway, I'll keep all that in mind...

> Cerberus had 3 head, not 2.

Duh! I know that. What I didn't know was that the Greeks had a two-headed
dog monster as well. Besides, every single monstrous canine in every game
this side of Ancient Greece is called "Cerberus" (including the cute
flayed ones in Resident Evil) anyway, so that's blas.

So it seems - Orthrus, brother of Cerberus. Why not rename the Two-headed
Dog "Orthrus", then? (Jakub?) That'll please the mythology buffs! (And
astonish the rest.)

A very good idea. Maybe the beneficial effects degrade every single time
the player uses the Genetic Machine.

Hehehe... another classic! (What is it with these immensely strong bad
guys, anyway? Why do they have to use backhand blows, when they could
easily tear the hero's head off with a good old fashioned right hook?)
Yeah, a good point. It's quite enough for a lowly Claw Rat to have but one
attack, but with "bosses" one should always go all-out for making them
memorable, and different attack descriptions and effects are a simple way
to do that.

...Bearing in mind still that we also have to invent even better rewards
for all the later bosses, who'll be even tougher...

A random thought: if we're going to have "Dr William Birkin's evil twin"
at the end of the Genetic Lab, why not leave obnoxious clues like signing
the ravings on the Genetic Machine "W.B."? ^_^

And can we have a small-ish (but still random) "mini-level" for the good
doctor to run around in (I've found that confined spaces generally work
best for such singular enemies)? On the other tentacle, a predetermined
layout (like the Escape Pods) or a semi-random one (like the City) might
more easily put him in the position of advantage where we want him...

This is something I meant to bring up myself: we'll need different ammo
types for other weapon besides shotguns. These are all very good suggestions,
and probably more than we'll ever need! Rubber bullets don't seem very
useful in a kill-or-be-killed game, but if they're the only type on hand,
it'll be better than waiting for them to come and get you... I gather that
a "fire" bullet like that could be created by filling a cavity in the bullet
with magnesium oxide, but I'm no physicist. I've also long had this idea of
calling such an incendiary round a "Flashpoint bullet", and (given that the
shotgun shells have cool names like "Hi-Acc" or "Sharp") I humbly offer
this as a proposed name.

One factor has to be that way, way more Lovecraft has been translated into
Finnish, than Derleth. (I prefer to read books in the original language
whenever possible, but I belong to the vocal minority!)

I think I now know the reason why most of us cannot last very long after
the City (at least, one of the reasons - besides the fact that it's still
an unfinished game). It's because the experience required for the next
level doubles after every level increase. You're likely to be fourth or
fifth level after making your way through the Shuttle, which means that
you need around two to four thousand XP for the next level. But as the
average amount of XP gained for killing one of the creatures found in those
areas is about 125, you need to kill dozens of monsters just to gain a
single level (at an average +2 HP per level...). Compare this to the
average XP of slightly over 75 on the Shuttle levels - thirteen or fourteen
kills and you've gone from first to third level. The rate of advance slows,
while the nasties keep getting meaner, meaning that slip-ups become more
deadly, even as they become more frequent.

Well, you won't be hearing (much) anything else from me on player psionics, 
unless Jakub wants to implement them as very limited genetic adaptations and/or 
implants. I've also said all I have to say on the matter of hallucinations. 
And I don't think that much more can be said about finding the legendary 
Ancient relic "The Scroll of Omnipotence"...

Well, I was taking "morte" from Italian.  But Vocomors is good, if Jakub 
likes it, that is. Onto the next order of buisness...

Yes, you are right. If they're relatively rare, then the player won't be 
expecting them...
 
What about a boss monster that can go through walls, maybe in the alien 
ruins? Perhaps a force field seals you in a room with it, and you have to fight it 
to the death. Only it retreats into the walls when weak, which means you have 
to find a way to destroy the walls...

I like this idea. I think that certain, extremely powerful enemies should 
announce their presences through sound. Like how the titans shake the floor in 
ADOM. Also, shouldn't the player be able to hear gunfire? (You hear gunfire!)

Well, yes, some of it comes from Eternal darkness, but that was a highly 
graphical game, and limited in what it could do in terms of insanity effects (just 
a text message "Your fingers have mouths and eyes!" wouldn't cut it I'm 
afraid).
 
I do think that a horror roguelike could be great, if done properly.

Read Milton and Dante if you want some interesting insights into Hell's 
landscape. But you've probably already read some of "Paradise Lost" and "The Divine 
Comedy".

Cerberus had 3 head, not 2. But there was a dog in Greek Myth that had two 
heads, as well. Anyway, maybe there comes a point where the player cannot splice 
anymore DNA with his own without incurring horrible, horrible side effects. 
That way he would have to limit himself to only a couple of stat modifications. 
Of course, he could always un-splice (de-splice?) his DNA, allowing him to 
gain a new ability...

Well, I see how good and evil and right and wrong can be used in relativistic 
ways, but I also believe that good and evil are very objective. "Good" is the 
pinnacle of order, purity, reason and being. Good is something. "Evil" is the 
absence of good. It is the absence of order, purity, reason and being. It 
substitutes these things for chaos, taint, idiocy and annihilation. The same way 
that cold is the absence of heat, and darkness is the absence of light, evil 
is the absence of good.
 
Such is my understanding :)

Wow, that's different from over here, where most "Lovecraft" fans are 
actually bigger fans of Derleth than HPL himself. I think a lot of it comes from 
Chaosium's "Call of Cthulhu" RPG, which has a heavy Derlethian influence (they 
even use Derleth's version of the Elder Sign, instead of Lovecraft's). So a lot 
of people start reading Lovecraft and interpreting his writings using what 
they've learned from Derleth. Which is sad, really, because he's nowhere near as 
great a creative mind as was Lovecraft. I'm just glad I'm not the only one who 
holds that opinion :)

Yes, and in doing so he has to reveal the one critical flaw in his plan that 
allows you to defeat him. And right before he lowers you into the shark tank, 
he and all of his henchmen have to leave, except for one guy who the player 
knocks into the water, and the sharks eat him instead.
 
This is starting to sound like a James Bond film! All we need is a giant 
LASER that cuts people in half.

I like the idea of having boss-type monsters in a roguelike. I think that it 
really adds a new element to them.
 
Though they should have more methods of attack than normal enemies. Like 
maybe the mad-scientist is so powerful that he can send the player flying into the 
wall by back-handing him?

I would really recommend the Genetic Machine upgrade, and maybe a pill that 
increase stats by a few points. This guy ain't gonna be easy, so the reward 
should be substantial.

Well, let's see...
 
A lot of Ancient alien relics would work nicely for this, but for now I'll 
try and keep it simple and stick mostly to human devices.
 
ICE BOLT: A coolant spray, probably from some kind of fire-extinguishing tool
 
LIGHTNING BOLT: An ion rifle
 
ANY "BALL" ATTACK: Different kinds of grenades. There could even be a 
freeze-grenade, a plasma grenade, an EMP grenade (for destroying robots), a nerve-gas 
grenade, a tear-gas grenade, a harmful nanite-cloud grenade...
 
LEVITATION: Can also be accomplished through anti-gravity boots and/or 
vest/belt that can be activated to allow the player to float above harmful terrains. 
Maybe certain small enemies couldn't reach him while he's flying?
 
TELEPORT: Probably an Ancient space-warping artefact that allows the player 
to warp to a random nearby location. It would probably recharge itself after 
being used. Could it be combined with another relic to allow the player 
controlled teleporting ability?
 
TELEPORT MONSTER: Perhaps the same artefact could be used against monsters? 
Maybe it's some kind of "Chrono-Sceptre" that could freeze monsters in a stasis 
field, too? It would have to be pretty rare, though.
 
BERSERK RAGE: Perhaps there's a super adrenaline-boosting type of pill that 
acts similar to the berserker potion in crawl? The player gains temporary stat 
boosts, but afterward he is completely drained physically.
 
LIGHT AREA: Well, this is obvious, isn't it? If there's ever a place that is 
too dark for the player to see in, flashlights are always a good idea.
 
EGO ITEMS: In terms of ammo, let's take a look at the 8mm pistol bullet. A 
"stun" bullet could be made of rubber, an "ice" bullet could have a gel-capsule 
in the tip filled with a super-compressed coolant, a "fire" bullet could be 
filled with a combustible fluid the same way that the ice bullets are filled 
with coolant, let's not forget more powerful hollow point bullets, as well. Other 
ammo's could have similar effects. As for armour, a suit of Trooper Armour 
could easily become a "Trooper Armour of fire resistance" by adding special 
heat-resistant fibres. So you could have a "heat resistant Trooper Armour" or a 
"thermo-tolerant trooper armour" or something like that. In fact, you could have 
a "thermal Trooper Armour" (cold resistant), an "insulated Trooper Armour" 
(electricity resistant), a "reinforced Trooper Armour" (armour-piercing 
resistant), a "stealth Trooper Armour" (with a built-in limited cloaking device), or 
even an "advanced Trooper Armour" (made out of advanced materials so it is 
stronger, and it can resist corrosion). How would these item's presences be 
explained in the game? There was probably more than just genetic research going on 
illegally on Tartarus, would be my guess.
 
Well, that's about all for now in terms of techno-magic. Onto the next order 
of business...

I second the idea for a giant computer. It would be interesting if its main 
core was surrounded by a force-field, and so the player would have to take out 
the force-field generators first...
 
If this hypothetical computer is destroyed, does the player have a limited 
time to escape before it blows up?

I like the idea for making other actions give experience. I think it makes 
sense.
 
As for the Mines and the Lab being beatable, I think that either more ammo 
and firepower, or less powerful enemies are in order. Especially that Giant 
Wasp. It's poison is way too powerful. Though once the skill system is fully 
implemented, things may not be so difficult.
 
I do think that certain enemies should be able to take less of a beating 
before dying, though.
 
Not that I don't want the game to be challenging. I just don't want it to be 
impossible to win :)
 
Anyway, God Bless,
 
   -Steve

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Well, you won't be hearing (much) anything else from me on player psionics, unless Jakub wants to implement them as very limited genetic adaptations and/or implants.

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;Actually, "death" in Latin is "mors", which would give us "Vocomors". I'm<BR>&gt;happy enough with that. Thanks. Let's move on...</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;&gt; I love wall-ignoring monsters. Why? Because, I fell that they add a lot to<BR>&gt;&gt; the gameplay. Like the ghosts in ADOM and Angband.<BR>&gt;&gt;</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;True, they heighten the feeling of paranoia. But because of that very<BR>&gt;reason, they cannot be too common. If there's creatures popping out of<BR>&gt;walls left and right, the player will simply feel overwhelmed (and prob-<BR>&gt;ably a little cheated - "Why am I the only one here who has to go around<BR>&gt;walls?"), and will be tempted just to give up. But then, Jakub seems to<BR>&gt;have plans only to have them in a couple of places, which makes it all<BR>&gt;right.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Yes, you are right. If they're relatively rare, then the player won't be expecting them...</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">What about a boss monster that can go through walls, maybe in the alien ruins? Perhaps a force field seals you in a room with it, and you have to fight it to the death. Only it retreats into the walls when weak, which means you have to find a way to destroy the walls...</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;Hey - yeah! That's exactly the sort of "intertextuality" (ie. high-brow<BR>&gt;theft) that adds atmosphere to a game, without being so underlined that<BR>&gt;it makes the player squirm.<BR>&gt;(And, there's also that point that has been made a couple of times already<BR>&gt;- that there should be some sounds here and there. The robots got a head<BR>&gt;start, now that they tell the player when they're having trouble. Others<BR>&gt;can follow suit and begin to speak.

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">I like this idea.

I guess that<BR>&gt;system owes a lot to "Eternal Darkness", but given all the nice things<BR>&gt;I've heard about the game, that's probably just another case of stealing<BR>&gt;from the best. In a way it's a pity the chairman voted "against"! Some-<BR>&gt;thing like this certainly deserves to be used in a Roguelike. Come to<BR>&gt;think of it, there haven't been ...any?... horror-genre Roguelikes.<BR>&gt;Maybe it's time to get someone on the r.g.r.d to do it... ^_^ </FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Well, yes, some of it comes from Eternal darkness, but that was a highly graphical game, and limited in what it could do in terms of insanity effects (just a text message "Your fingers have mouths and eyes!" wouldn't cut it I'm afraid).</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;And I can console you, Steve. I'm definitely going to use your ideas very<BR>&gt;carefully when (and if!) I get around to making my pet project, "DOOM the<BR>&gt;RPG", a reality. It's going to need some disturbing visions of Hell, and<BR>&gt;a touch of insanity can really boost the role-playing... *evil grin*</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Read Milton and Dante if you want some interesting insights into Hell's landscape. But you've probably already read some of "Paradise Lost" and "The Divine Comedy".</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;That WOULD be what you'd expect from a DNA-splicing machine, wouldn't it?<BR>&gt;But then, it would run amok with game balance: you could just pick and<BR>&gt;choose for yourself the strength of the Two-headed Dog (shouldn't that be<BR>&gt;called the "Cerberus" or something?), the speed of the Small Critter, the<BR>&gt;toughness of the Genotroid, and so on.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Cerberus had 3 head, not 2. But there was a dog in Greek Myth that had two heads, as well. Anyway, maybe there comes a point where the player cannot splice anymore DNA with his own without incurring horrible, horrible side effects. That way he would have to limit himself to only a couple of stat modifications. Of course, he could always un-splice (de-splice?) his DNA, allowing him to gain a new ability...</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;Lovecraft does a terrific job of painting a picture of a cosmic order in<BR>&gt;which the human race has absolutely no significance whatsoever. That's an<BR>&gt;arresting thought. IMHO, "good" and "evil" are abstract conceptions;<BR>&gt;"right" and "wrong" relative terms that the human mind simplifies in<BR>&gt;order to be able to cope with a complex world. Which doesn't stop me from<BR>&gt;trying to live up to this Discordian ideal...<BR>&gt;"Always Do Right. This will gratify many people, and astonish the rest."<BR>&gt;^_^</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Well, I see how good and evil and right and wrong can be used in relativistic ways, but I also believe that good and evil are very objective. "Good" is the pinnacle of order, purity, reason and being. Good is something. "Evil" is the absence of good. It is the absence of order, purity, reason and being. It substitutes these things for chaos, taint, idiocy and annihilation. The same way that cold is the absence of heat, and darkness is the absence of light, evil is the absence of good.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;Oh, that's right! August Derleth! You know, I've been discussing the<BR>&gt;Mythos with several friends (in totally unconnected occasions), and it<BR>&gt;always came around to trying to remember the name of "that guy who wrecked<BR>&gt;Lovecraft's vision". Thank you, I'll remember it now.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Wow, that's different from over here, where most "Lovecraft" fans are actually bigger fans of Derleth than HPL himself. I think a lot of it comes from Chaosium's "Call of Cthulhu" RPG, which has a heavy Derlethian influence (they even use Derleth's version of the Elder Sign, instead of Lovecraft's). So a lot of people start reading Lovecraft and interpreting his writings using what they've learned from Derleth. Which is sad, really, because he's nowhere near as great a creative mind as was Lovecraft. I'm just glad I'm not the only one who holds that opinion :)</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;Oh dear... the next thing we know, he'll be making speeches about the<BR>&gt;grandeur of his plans before putting the player in an insanely-complicated-<BR>&gt;and-easily-foiled death trap... ^_^;</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Yes, and in doing so he has to reveal the one critical flaw in his plan that allows you to defeat him. And right before he lowers you into the shark tank, he and all of his henchmen have to leave, except for one guy who the player knocks into the water, and the sharks eat him instead.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;But, it's still a good idea. He'll<BR>&gt;probably be the first "boss" the player encounters, and will be a nice<BR>&gt;introduction to the idea that there are such "videogame-y" elements in<BR>&gt;Xenocide, before siccing the big giant monsters on the player.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">I like the idea of having boss-type monsters in a roguelike. I think that it really adds a new element to them.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">Though they should have more methods of attack than normal enemies. Like maybe the mad-scientist is so powerful that he can send the player flying into the wall by back-handing him?</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Courier New">&gt;Laboratory-type stuff, not weapons, preferably.

A "stun" bullet could be made of rubber, an "ice" bullet could have a gel-capsule in the tip filled with a super-compressed coolant, a "fire" bullet could be filled with a combustible fluid the same way that the ice bullets are filled with coolant, let's not forget more powerful hollow point bullets, as well. Other ammo's could have similar effects. As for armour, a suit of Trooper Armour could easily become a "Trooper Armour of fire resistance" by adding special heat-resistant fibres. So you could have a "heat resistant Trooper Armour" or a "thermo-tolerant trooper armour" or something like that. In fact, you could have a "thermal Trooper Armour" (cold resistant), an "insulated Trooper Armour" (electricity resistant), a "reinforced Trooper Armour" (armour-piercing resistant), a "stealth Trooper Armour" (with a built-in limited cloaking device), or even an "advanced Trooper Armour" (made out of advanced materials so it is stronger, and it can resist corrosion). How would these item's presences be explained in the game? There was probably more than just genetic research going on illegally on Tartarus, would be my guess.</FONT></SPAN></P>

It needn't be much, maybe something like 50-100 XP,<BR>&gt;or perhaps 100 points per current experience level just to account for the<BR>&gt;ever-increasing level-up requirements. Just a little something to show the<BR>&gt;player some appreciation for having made it that far. (And maybe - just<BR>&gt;maybe - make the Lab and Mines a tad more survivable!)</FONT></SPAN></P>

Well, it would probably lurk in the walls and wait till the player is alone 
and wounded, and then move in for the kill. It's a cowardly sort of monster. It 
is very weak against electricity and heat (so a grenade or a flamethrower 
would be more effective), but it takes more fire-power to harm it, because it can 
pass through matter. If it gets hurt too badly, it will retreat into the 
walls, until it has fully recovered.

Perhaps a pill that increases all stats by 2 or 3 points? Or maybe he had 
additional software for the genetic machine, that would allow the player to use 
that one disabled option (I can't remember its name)?
 
>1. No one reads messages in roguelikes.
 
Well, I do...

Darn, and just when I had thought of another hallucination ("Your organs 
suddenly explode from out of your stomach and spill onto the floor! You bend over 
and try to scoop them back inside of yourself."). Well, Xenocide can't have 
everything :)
 
And I got to think that, yeah, such a system would greatly effect the 
gameplay. It would be suited better for a pure horror setting. I might just revise 
the idea and post it up on UseNet.
 
>It's fine too. How would you change then:
>"The forces of Earth had no idea what kind of organisms they were up 
>against, though several reports from the front lines seemed to indicated >that the 
creatures may have been insectoid in appearance."
 
Maybe it should read "The forces of Earth had no idea what kind of organisms 
they were up against, though there are rumours told amongst soldiers of 
strange, insectoid creatures that inhabit large bio-mechanical suits."
 
>As I wrote - pretty cool ideas, but I have to resign of them.
 
Like I said, I understand. But would there be at least a pill or something 
that temporarily makes the player see things, like Antti originally suggested? 
Something simple, where everything changes colour (like a rainbow) and their 
are weird adjectives in front of object and creature names (I really liked 
Antti's idea for finding something like a "two-headed metal trinket" or a 
"ten-gallon claw rat") and some monsters have weird or silly names (like when the 
player eat a mushroom of hallucinations in Angband, with one enemy being a "giant 
stalk of celery" and another being "a greater cosmic death-lord" or something 
along those lines). Would that be too hard to implement? Or is it just not what 
you had in mind for Xenocide?
 
I don't mean to seem pushy. If you reject the idea this time, then I'll let 
it drop. I can be a reasonable person, sometimes :)
 
Anyway, Jakub, I hope you enjoy your trips. God Bless,
 
   -Steve

You know, this might not be such a bad idea, IMHO. But I suppose it could be 
somewhat limiting, too, in terms of gameplay flexibility. I think that it 
would be best to keep the classes as they are now, and once Jakub has implemented 
the skill system and added more tools and items, then it may be more obvious 
as to whether or not the medic and the scientist are similar enough to be 
combined into one class.

You know, I think that the focus on gameplay is one reason I'm drawn to 
Roguelikes. Since they're graphically simple, and they don't offer much in the way 
of special effects or cinematics, they have to be fun to get people to play 
them.
 
Of course, I still have fond memories of many old, old games that everyone 
else but me has forgotten. Everything from the old text adventure "Zork", to the 
original space shooters such as "Space Invaders", "Asteroids", and "Galaga", 
to the Atari 2600 game "Adventure", to the NES classic "Rygar"...
 
I get so nostalgic sometimes :)
 
>There's just something very compelling about the aesthetics of flying
>cartridge cases!
 
Yes, there is. I find it ironic sometimes that we humans have, throughout 
history, romanticized all of the weapons that we used to kill each other. The 
sound of a gun being cocked, or fired, or the cylinder on a revolver being spun 
shut, or even the simple motion of pumping a pump-action shotgun are all, well, 
"cool", for lack of a better word.
 
Since we haven't yet begun to use railguns and LASER guns in combat to any 
extent, we haven't been able to really romanticize them in our minds. Of course, 
it is mostly personal weapons that we tend to romanticize, not siege engines 
or bombs, so said weapons would have to be small enough for one soldier to 
easily use. That's my theory, anyway :)
 
>See, Steve? You were right about the Teutonic Knights... ^_^
 
I knew it! :D
 
>That sounds
>like a fun story (well, maybe not reason enough to start learning Polish),
>and somehow, that synopsis reminds me of Philip K. Dick's stories.

>(or images of pre-Roman Germanic tribes). "Templars"?
 
Yes, Templars could work, but many roguelikes plagiarize. And since no one's 
making money off of Xenocide, I doubt that anyone would complain.
 
>What, two lives would be enough for you? I think I'd need at least five...
 
I remember reading somewhere about a metaphysical principal called 
"bilocation", where one man could simultaneously exist in two places at once. You should 
try looking into that, Jakub :)
 
God Bless,
 
   -Steve

We should soon be reaching a point where most topics discussed so far
come to some sort of conclusion, and these incessant, overlong messages
gradually shorten and stop. That is, until someone sends in the next
batch of monsters/implants/weapons/ideas...

> Splitter description: .....

Actually, "death" in Latin is "mors", which would give us "Vocomors". I'm
happy enough with that. Thanks. Let's move on...

Sure! A single drop of the Alien's blood ate through half a dozen decks
of the Nostromo. I wonder, what could the floors and walls of the LV-426
colony have been made of? I mean, I don't recall seeing a huge crater in
the corridor where the sentry guns blasted the hordes of Aliens?
*Ahem* I'll go look up "artistic licence" in my dictionary... ^_^;

Cool! We could have these in the vicinity of alien power sources and so

True, they heighten the feeling of paranoia. But because of that very
reason, they cannot be too common. If there's creatures popping out of
walls left and right, the player will simply feel overwhelmed (and prob-
ably a little cheated - "Why am I the only one here who has to go around
walls?"), and will be tempted just to give up. But then, Jakub seems to
have plans only to have them in a couple of places, which makes it all
right.

> Well, there should be one monster that announces its presences by spouting

>
Hey - yeah! That's exactly the sort of "intertextuality" (ie. high-brow
theft) that adds atmosphere to a game, without being so underlined that
it makes the player squirm.
(And, there's also that point that has been made a couple of times already
- that there should be some sounds here and there. The robots got a head
start, now that they tell the player when they're having trouble. Others
can follow suit and begin to speak. All highlighted, of course, so that
they draw the player's attention accordingly.)

That's simply revolting. Yes, we have to have that. (Besides, it's good
for constant experience - a make-your-own-monsters kit! Yeecch! Am I being
morbid again or what?)

[And so on and so on and on and ON...]

WHOAH! :O You've really thought this one out, haven't you? I guess that
system owes a lot to "Eternal Darkness", but given all the nice things
I've heard about the game, that's probably just another case of stealing
from the best. In a way it's a pity the chairman voted "against"! Some-
thing like this certainly deserves to be used in a Roguelike. Come to
think of it, there haven't been ...any?... horror-genre Roguelikes.
Maybe it's time to get someone on the r.g.r.d to do it... ^_^

[Jakub:]

And I can console you, Steve. I'm definitely going to use your ideas very
carefully when (and if!) I get around to making my pet project, "DOOM the
RPG", a reality. It's going to need some disturbing visions of Hell, and
a touch of insanity can really boost the role-playing... *evil grin*

I still say there should be some sort of "narcotic" drugs interspersed
with all the medical and poisonous pharmaceuticals. If only to confuse
the player (as in, randomising his movement).

> (especially since most people who are bombarded by

So I've heard. @_@; As I told Jakub a long time ago, my current favourite
excuse for mutating living tissue on the spot are biological/chemical
compounds, as there is much more variety there (and less research results).
Everybody knows radiation does not make you sprout extra arms, but some
exotic biochem solution just might...

That WOULD be what you'd expect from a DNA-splicing machine, wouldn't it?
But then, it would run amok with game balance: you could just pick and
choose for yourself the strength of the Two-headed Dog (shouldn't that be
called the "Cerberus" or something?), the speed of the Small Critter, the
toughness of the Genotroid, and so on.

Lovecraft does a terrific job of painting a picture of a cosmic order in
which the human race has absolutely no significance whatsoever. That's an
arresting thought. IMHO, "good" and "evil" are abstract conceptions;
"right" and "wrong" relative terms that the human mind simplifies in
order to be able to cope with a complex world. Which doesn't stop me from
trying to live up to this Discordian ideal...
"Always Do Right. This will gratify many people, and astonish the rest."
^_^

Oh, that's right! August Derleth! You know, I've been discussing the
Mythos with several friends (in totally unconnected occasions), and it
always came around to trying to remember the name of "that guy who wrecked
Lovecraft's vision". Thank you, I'll remember it now.

This would be realistic (argh! there's that "r" word again), and would
certainly add another dimension to using automatic fire... But, I do think
that Xenocide will do better with the tactical decisions involved in only
having one ammunition type in a weapon at once.

> OK, there will be a Mad Doctor at the end of Genetic Lab
>
Oh dear... the next thing we know, he'll be making speeches about the
grandeur of his plans before putting the player in an insanely-complicated-
and-easily-foiled death trap... ^_^; But, it's still a good idea. He'll
probably be the first "boss" the player encounters, and will be a nice
introduction to the idea that there are such "videogame-y" elements in
Xenocide, before siccing the big giant monsters on the player.

> What do you think, what kind of items should he have

Laboratory-type stuff, not weapons, preferably. That chemical analyser...
Some of the rarer, more powerful drug types... A gadget for better control
over what traits the Genetic Machine imparts from monsters... Something
like that.

> No, no. There won't be any psionics. It's too magic-like. I don't want

NO psionics? Does that mean that they flat-out do not exist (no Psymould?),
or just that there won't be any that the player can use? (Anyway, I have
to say that's a commendable, bold decision. I've said it before and I'll
say it again - the strength of any good Roguelike lies in its apparent
simplicity and approachability.)

Also, I refer once again to Mr Clarke! Take any effect usually connected
with magic or psionics, and chances are you can devise a super-tech excuse
for creating a similar effect. In fact, I've been meaning to compile such
a list for quite some time! How about another "idea competition", Steve?

- INVISIBILITY: cloaking device.
- FIREBALL: plasma projector (my, that was easy).
- PROTECTION: force field.
- DETECT MONSTERS: infra-red scanner.
- HOLD MONSTER: stasis field.
- SLEEP: knockout gas (or a sonic stunner).
- TELEKINESIS: tractor beam.
- LEVITATION: repulsor beam!
- TELEPATHY: brain-wave projection/detection.

I got all the easy ones... ^_^;

> In Genotroid Hatchery - a Genotroid Queen? (Yeah, the "Alien" movie,
>
Or would that be a little TOO obvious? (The Genotroids are already repre-
sented by the "A" character...) If the Genotroids really are a warrior race
bioengineered by the Enemy, wouldn't they have devised a more easily
controlled method of reproduction, such as an artificial incubator?
(It could still be a big, impressive, heavily defended piece of "boss"
machinery, with auto-tracking lasers and mini-missiles galore.)

I'll again raise a subject I proposed to Jakub some time earlier: the idea
of "exploration experience". I still think it would make a great addition
to the game to have SOME other means of gaining levels other than whacking
aliens over the head. It needn't be much, maybe something like 50-100 XP,
or perhaps 100 points per current experience level just to account for the
ever-increasing level-up requirements. Just a little something to show the
player some appreciation for having made it that far. (And maybe - just
maybe - make the Lab and Mines a tad more survivable!)

I plan to add such creatures in caves and in rad desert.
Monster will be able to hide in a rock (through a small hole).

nice.
I prefer such ideas for monster. What will be original in it,
what tactic it will use to fight player and what player will be able
to do to kill it.

OK, there will be a Mad Doctor at the end of Genetic Lab
"Ya won't get me, ya ugly aliens! Look at me! Bwahahaha". I like the
idea very much. What do you think, what kind of items should he have
as a reward for killing?

No, no. There won't be any psionics. It's too magic-like. I don't want
to do magic in my game. There will be some tools instead that can do some
(stun, confuse etc.)

In Genotroid Hatchery - a Genotroid Queen? (Yeah, the "Alien" movie,

be with reliable flamethrower...)

Well... I have to sadden you. I won't implement madness and
halucinations in Xenocide.
1. No one reads messages in roguelikes.
2. The gameplay would be completely different.
3. I recommend you to send your sanity system into
rec.games.roguelike.development group :) It's good, but not for Xeno.

I like it again (things that I dislike or can't comment have been
cutted, sorry).
I made it with 2 entries. The first one two days before next - 2 page
long - next one.

It's fine too. How would you change then:
"The forces of Earth had no idea what kind of organisms they were up against,
though several reports from the front lines seemed to indicated that
the creatures may have been insectoid in appearance."

As I wrote - pretty cool ideas, but I have to resign of them.

Actually, I've been playing a little game called "Eternal Darkness: Sanity'=

yes, the player can go insane.

=20
Hm... That could work. But I think an insanity system could work if it was=
=20
implemented ala "Eternal Darkness" (the aforementioned game). In said game,=
 the=20
player loses a little bit of sanity when certain horrible things happen to=
=20
him, such as seeing a human explode or being spotted by a horrible monster.=
 The=20
player can regain his sanity in a variety of ways, one by killing the creat=
ures=20
that made him lose his sanity in the first place, two by magic (we can't ha=
ve=20
that in Xenocide, though) and three, by using certain items. One of the=20
characters in the game could even drink liquor to recover his sanity.
=20
Now, how would this be implemented in Xenocide? Well, I'd say that the play=
er=20
would have a sanity metre, and that him witnessing certain events would=20
decrease that metre. Some events include seeing dead bodies, seeing particu=
larly=20
horrible monsters, or coming close to death himself. Of course, it would ta=
ke a=20
very long time for the player to go insane, Just seeing a few bodies might=
=20
frighten the player, it might sicken him, freak him out or unnerve him, but=
 not=20
drive him completely insane. Plus, the more dead bodies a player sees, the =
more=20
desensitised he becomes, so dead bodies are less likely to ebb away at his=
=20
sanity.
=20
Now, the earliest sanity effects would probably be mild, hardly noticeable,=
=20
such as "You feel an itch on the back of your neck", or "A sudden chill cra=
wls=20
across your body", "You get that sudden sinking feeling". Stuff like that.
=20
Now, it would take a lot more than seeing a few claw rats to drive the play=
er=20
crazy. The player would treat dangerous claw rats like most people would=20
treat any dangerous animal, and most people don't go insane just because a =
dog is=20
chasing them.
=20
Anyway, if sanity was implemented, it would be regain able, to some degree.=
=20
There would have to be "bracketed" sanity levels, where when your sanity go=
es=20
below one bracket it is hard to recover above it. Hmm, maybe a graph would =
help=20
demonstrate better.
=20
In this chart there are three sanity brackets. Each bracket is divided into=
=20
upper, middle and lower levels. Insanity effects become progressively worse=
 as=20
the player becomes more insane. Once he falls to the next lower bracket, it=

sudden be faced with every nightmare imaginable, even if his sanity drops f=
rom 100%=20
to 1% in one turn. So once he goes from upper to middle he wouldn't start=20
experiencing every horror that there is.
=20
Sanity would not be that easy to lose, especially since the player can beco=
me=20
desensitised to things, so that they no longer ebb away at his sanity. Of=20
course, certain monsters can shatter the player's mind, and some drive him =
more=20
insane than others, so going insane wouldn't be quite so rare.
=20
In order to recover sanity, the player would need only to be in a situation=
=20
where he's not being threatened directly. So long as he is not fighting, an=
d he=20
is at full health, and there are particularly nasty monsters on the same=20
level as him, then he will slowly begin to regain health.
=20
Certain items, pills and syringes, could be used to tranquillize the mind a=
nd=20
allow it to heal. Maybe nano neuro-reconstructors? Or a brain-wave interfac=
e=20
device that reorders information in the mind and heals trauma? And perhaps =
a=20
'mental stabilizer' implant that makes it harder for the player to go insan=
e.
=20
Now, in this rough draft idea, the only way to go up into a higher bracket=
=20
would be to stay at 100% sanity for a long, long time. Then a message, such=
 as=20
"Your thoughts feel more focused, and less clouded" or something like that=
=20
would occur.
=20
Whew. That's basically the idea behind sanity. I know it sounds like a=20
nightmare to program, but I think it would be worth it.
=20
Although...
=20
>(The "insanity effect" of certain beings

=20
That *could* work too, but...

Anyway, onto the next order of business.

=20
Actually, analysing different enemy DNAs and then integrating them into the=
=20
player's would work better (especially since most people who are bombarded =
by=20
gamma rays end up terminally ill, and not gaining super-powers). It would b=

=20
Well, there would probably still be wars, but the corporations (wanting to=

have the advantage in case anyone comes after THEM) have generally hidden t=

knowledge of advanced weapons, and kept them to themselves. And the general=

Well, you're right. It's more like the warp drive than anything. But that's=

=20
Yes, that is true, but I still find the comic entertaining. In truth, thoug=

I always=20

=20
I think who we have to blame for this misconception are all the "Mythos"=20
writers who came after Lovecraft, namely Derleth. Yes, he did help Lovecraf=
t's own=20
writings survive to this day, but his own writings dealing with Cthulhu and=
=20
whatnot are very different from Ech Pi El's, not to mention no where as=20
creative, IMHO. Anyway, Derleth tended to divide all of Lovecraft's entitie=
s into=20
"Good guys" and "Bad guys". Lovecraft, on the other hand, portrayed most of=
 them=20
as self-serving creatures who are generally animalistic in their attitudes=
=20
toward morals. They were less immoral and more ammoral. Anyway...

=20
Jakub and I discussed this. The 'Atlas' was supposed to be an ore transport=
,=20
taking raw ore from the colony on Tartarus to factories, where it is=20
processed, turned into weapons and sent to the front lines of the war. Only=
 the=20
corporation (which I named 'GenTech'... Generic Technology. It can be chang=
ed if you=20
want, Jakub...) was using it to 'illegally' (illegally in quotes because th=
is=20
corporation exists outside of the law) ship animals to the secret genetic l=
ab=20
on Tartarus, where unlawful experiments were being performed.
=20
And I'm pretty the shuttle is supposed to be a shuttle arriving from the=20
Atlas, laden with creatures. The creatures would be offloaded by corporate=
=20
personnel, and then ore would be on loaded. Hmm... Maybe the Genetic Machin=
e should=20
read...
=20
=3D=3D=3D
=20
- Success, finally! The GenMachine works fine, and the DNA integration went=
=20
as expected. Now I wait for the mega-freighter to arrive. What was it calle=
d?=20
The "Atlas" was it? It doesn't matter, so long as it gets here soon. I hope=
 it=20
gets here soon.
=20
- I wonder how can GenTech can demand results, when all I have to work with=
=20
are the same old samples! I hope the freighter arrives soon. It is smugglin=
g in=20
a cache of alien life forms for me to experiment on, under the guise of=20
picking up raw ore for processing. Then I will have new DNA to experiment w=
ith!=20
Then this project will finally begin to move forward!
=20
- I grow restless in waiting. Maybe I should ask one of these stupid miners=
=20
for help in the lab? No, they won't ever understand how important my work i=
s.=20
They're all narrow minded idiots! And these strange deaths recently. They b=
lame=20
my creations for the killings, and no matter how much I tell them that my=20
creatures are locked away and cannot harm them, I cannot seem to convince t=
hem=20
otherwise. They are too foolish to see that there can be only one possible=
=20
explanation for these murders. There must by a mad man amongst them, a seri=
al=20
killer with a lust for blood. Yes, a serial killer, yes.
=20
=3D=3D=3D
=20
Something like that. I did take a little creative licence, BTW. Using my=20
version, it might work better having the past 3 entries left, but having th=
em all=20
in the same day.
=20
>Speaking of the Enemy, I recently thought of one type of Earth insect that

=20
Well, I'm the one who said insectoid, I think. I told Jakub that he could=20
make it anything he wanted, and I don't know if he wanted the Enemy to be=20
insectoid or if he didn't have an opinion.
=20
I personally think that some kind of super-intelligent, psychic, locust-lik=

creature would be best. With both endo and exoskeletons, for super defensiv=
e=20
power. And they should wear bio-mechanical suits, ala the aliens in the 199=
6=20
U.S. movie "Independence Day".
=20
*Sigh* That was a lot of writing. I'll have to write more some other time.=
=20
Tell me what you think of the proposed sanity system, won't you? I know it =
seems=20
rather complicated, but it is a very rough draft.
=20
So, until next time,

God Bless,

 I'd say that the player would have a sanity metre, and that him witnessing=

self. Of course, it would take a very long time for the player to go insane=

freak him out or unnerve him, but not drive him completely insane. Plus, th=

Really? If you can make that work, it'll be something never really seen
in a Roguelike before. Wouldn't that be something!
(Hmmm... Will that polyp be a flying one, by any chance?)

> Pills are small ;)
>
Hey! You said you aren't going for realism! O_o

> 150 EP in Class A Cell
> 200 EP in Plasma Cell (there will be different types of energy)
>
What I'm reminded of here are the Star Wars Dark Forces games (especially
the later ones that gradually got renamed "Jedi Knight" games). They had
three types of cells - Energy Cells, that powered ordinary blasters, Power
Cells, powering most of the heavier weapons, and Batteries, on which ran
your Field Light (and later, gadgets such as IR goggles and sniper scopes).
The point I'm making is that a single type of generic energy is plenty
(with different types of cells that fit different sockets and/or have
different power/weight ratios), but if several types are required, no
more than three will probably be needed...

> Some weapons (and tools?) will auto regenerate the energy, but it
>
I almost advised you against this, but then I remembered how I took it for
granted as a kid (back when I didn't worry about such things as realism)
that high-tech energy weapons would recharge themselves over time.
Technically, it would require a built-in miniature power plant (that
would eventually run out of fuel), but so what? We can just have them
exist, no questions asked.

Well, alien technology is a special case altogether - the player probably
won't ever understand the working principle, so all we need worry about
is the outward appearance. ("Wow - if I put my hand in here and wiggle
it around like so, lights and colours come out of that end?") Arthur C.
Clarke put it so very well: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic."

> It would... I still think how to make medic more worth to play.
>
Hey, I told you ages ago: lump the Scientist and Medic into one class.
Save yourself a lot of trouble. (As a bonus, you get a nice, clean,
efficient-looking three-way choice at character creation: Combat,
Scientific/Medical, or Mechanical training?)

> (I'm a big fan of 8 bit games)
>
Back when they didn't have the resources to build up impressive feature
lists involving five-digit figures, they had to make the games themselves
good in order to get anyone to play. I have found that all of the games
I find myself returning to over and over again were all made before 1995.
It's easy to immerse the player in impressive graphics and sound, easier
than having the game itself do it.

> I like old-school weapons in Xenocide. Why? I don't know, I just like

There's just something very compelling about the aesthetics of flying
cartridge cases! Also, guns are recognisable - the player doesn't need to
be told what to do with one. Contemporary elements also bring the action
"closer to home" - the game feels more down-to-earth, and therefore more
personal to the player - and by extension, enhances the fantastic feel
of the more high-tech items.

See, Steve? You were right about the Teutonic Knights... ^_^ That sounds
like a fun story (well, maybe not reason enough to start learning Polish),
and somehow, that synopsis reminds me of Philip K. Dick's stories.
But perhaps we were better off giving these chaps a new name, something
that gives the right impression but does not raise questions of plagiarism
(or images of pre-Roman Germanic tribes). "Templars"?

You know, this is brainstorming at its best. The way these wild ideas get
bounced off each other makes new ones just pop up like mushrooms, it's
great!

"Veni, vidi, respondi." ^_^

[Long colourful discussion on hallucinations deleted for health reasons]

Okay, what are you on? ^_^; Absolutely wonderful hallucinations you had
there! These certainly stimulate the imagination... I had the quick idea of
adding random adjectives to the names of things for a hallucinating player.
Things like "You see a turquoise Starcrawler", "There is a sobbing Leather
Jacket here", or "You dropped a three-legged Repair Tool." Or maybe simulate
"hearing things" by drawing random sentences from among all the messages in
Xenocide. Certain to creep out the player!

>
Mmmm. Xenocide does have a strong horror feel (perhaps that should be
"survival horror" <g>) already, and in any case whatever happened here does
seem to have driven everyone else bonkers, so why not the player? And yet,
I have some reservations. Insanity is such a touchy subject. In short - if
it's permanent, it would be pretty cruel on the player; and if it's not,
then what's the point? ^_^ I think most of what would be gained with an
insanity system can be achieved by implementing a versatile hallucination
system, and using it liberally. (The "insanity effect" of certain beings
could still be simulated by giving them a "hallucination attack" that
brings on a bout of hallucinations without leaving the character permanently
impaired - that is, if he manages to survive the encounter.)

The votes are tied at one for and one against. The chairman has the
casting vote...

[Re: mutations]
A nice, long list, and easily extended. Mutations would add a whole new
dimension to the game - for good as well as bad. On the negative side, it
would be a completely new facet to program and integrate into the interface.
Also, I fear such a system (where "mutations" are essentially "superpowers"
by another name) would unnecessarily remind players of fantasy games that
have done the same thing. Maybe (just maybe) another kind of system (such
as simply reusing the Genetic Machine code) could serve the uniqueness of
Xenocide better...

That's a good one. A likely situation - the "haves" like to maintain the
status quo, while still placating the "have-nots" with minor concessions -
plus, it underlines the power and ruthlessness of the corporations. And if
we need a rationalisation for a situation where Earthlings simply have not
developed anything much more advanced than maybe tomorrow's versions of
the guns we have today, all that needs to be described is a long period
of political horse-trading when researchers are appointed for political
and not scientific merits, and conflicts are solved with consumer products
and secret deals, instead of violence.

Phew! I thought I was the only one having trouble surviving for any length
of time... Yes, the lethality level does leap up somewhat after the City,
even with all the "new, improved" weapons you're likely to find there.

Well, it's been done both ways more than once - essentially, what you
describe is a warp drive from Star Trek! What matters is what the thing
does; everything else is window dressing. Also, there is the unfortunate
thing about clichs that they're recognisable. In a "generic SF" setting
(and let's not get into what exactly that means) like Xenocide, names are
important for the information they convey about the world, which the player
won't be familiar with. Everybody knows what a "Hyperdrive" is for; with
a "quasi-nucleonic particle fluctuator", it may not be so clear.

Heavy objects CAN be launched - but (if the energy input remains constant)
at lower muzzle velocities, which negatively impacts both the range, accuracy
and damage. It's more effective to accelerate lighter objects to greater
speeds.

No, that wouldn't do - the magnetic pulse has to travel down the rails in

Please wait while I lapse into a catatonic coma...
...There. Yes, highly disturbing. I think I'm better off NOT showing this
to a friend of mine, who collects Hello Kitty products, and does not like
horror as a genre...
Come to think of it, I had better also not showing this to my friends who
like Lovecraft... since they'd only complain how this comic unfairly
portrays Cthulhu as being a hateful, diabolical force of evil, when in
fact HPL made it clear that these Old Ones were simply so far beyond
human comprehension that their actions and decisions seem completely
alien to us.

It's a shame that I cannot refer you to my Aussie pal Mike Zacher's site
(as he seems to have taken it down) - his art gallery included the in-
famous "Cuddly Cthulhu" (a plush doll-like figure wearing a shirt that
read, "Love me... or die."), and also a hilarious photo showing Godzilla
(the original Toho rubber suit) holding a skyscraper, from which came a
speech bubble: "I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for
this, Mulder..."

> NOTE: These would be easier to do if there was an actual clip system,
>
I don't think such a system would add very much to the game, only make it
more complex. I think some detail is good, but only some - it's better to
have too little than too much. Anyway, tricks like "dropping the clip" are
easy enough to simulate - ammo in the gun drops to zero, and however much
was in the gun is now found as an item on the floor. (If the gun was empty,
the player must have been fumbling with a new magazine: drop a full gun's
worth of ammo.)

I think I might as well use this opportunity to mention what might be a
story discrepancy, or not. The story (beta) mentions that the mega-freighter
Atlas was transporting raw ore. (Also let's not get into how cheap and
efficient interstellar travel would have to be for THAT to be feasible...)
However, the notes on the Genetic Machine indicate that the researcher who
wrote them was expecting the Shuttle (not mega-freighter) in order to get
more test animals for his experiments. Now, this COULD be a reference to
another shipment entirely, but there is the fact that this is, apparently,
the "most recent note", and that the Shuttle is overflowing with all manner
of deadly critters... However did they get onboard an ore freighter?
(I know: the missiles that hit it were the Enemy's most insidious invention
- warheads filled with small, fuzzy, sickeningly cute creatures that sap
the will to fight of the most hardened space marine...)

Speaking of the Enemy, I recently thought of one type of Earth insect that
hasn't seen too much use as a basis for SF insectoid races: the fly. They
look pretty revolting up close, everyone knows what they are like, and
nobody likes them. They needn't even be able to fly (no pun intended) - in
fact, they could be described as having small vestigial wings that they
lost the use of while they were evolving to be big enough to contain an
advanced brain.

Just an idea...

Well now I am flabbergasted. Your first mail, Steve - the one with "All"
in the title - plunked down in my inbox looking very innocent. Then I
chanced to check the groups - and there was another one from you, one that
I had never seen. THEN Jakub sent his latest message - so far I've received
all of his - but I only saw it in the groups. This is getting strange. All
I did to SpamAssassin was tell it to save all incoming messages and not
delete anything, but those missing mails just never arrived. This has got
to be a problem with Yahoo! (though it's hard to tell about something that
isn't consistent).

That's a good one, too... bearing in mind that amoebae are single-cell
organisms, so be wary of references to cells in the plural. But they do
reproduce by division, so this is an appropriate choice. (A widely-used
one, too, which is why I went for something a little more unusual!) Perhaps
the "excuse" for the creatures getting weaker and finally being killed is
that when they divide too many times in a short span of time, the nutrients
in the cytoplasm are insufficient to support all of the individual "Split
Splitters."
(But where would this be explained to the player? O_o)

Yeah... it's just that I fear we'll have many, many "'morphs" in this
game before long. Also, many people will recognise both parts of that
name, lessening the "mystery". I'll think about this... "voconecor",
"voice-killer"? Naah...

Ah, actually, I didn't have quite that degree of transparency in mind -
more that its skin is transparent, and filled with translucent jelly.
But, if there is such an effect in the game, the Protoplasm could well
be made to be undetectable at a distance.

Hey, as soon as the word "dimensional" enters the picture, anything is
possible. @_@ Actually, I don't think this one should be able to ignore
physical barriers - it is, after all, a perfectly physical 3-D part of a
creature that just happens to extend into other dimensions as well!

> Freezing... That ads a whole new element of gameplay possibilities. Can the

Maybe, if Jakub says so! The Frostbite won't do it intentionally, though
- it's just an animal. But the particles it breathes can have that effect
if they miss. (Of course, the net effect of slipping probably won't be
anything more than a one- or two-turn Stun with an interesting description.)

Corrosive poison is unlikely in a living creature. The Slither wasn't
intended to be very dangerous, the poison spit was more of an afterthought.

The Dragonworm is described as "small", so it cannot be too srong. I've
been meaning to ask Jakub whether it would be possible to create "attack
patterns" for the monsters, to further enhance the illusion that these
are, in fact, real, living, breathing creatures (though that latter part
is easily corrected..). You know, real animals seldom run up to their
prey and fight toe to toe until death. The fact that injured creatures
sometimes run away does add a lot of believability to them, but in
actuality, many animals use hit-and-run tactics, especially flying ones.
Wouldn't it be interesting if certain monster types would fly (or run)
circles around the player, darting in to attack every now and then? Of
course, this wouldn't make the creature any more dangerous (since we're
not keeping track of facing, so it cannot strike you in the back) - rather
the opposite, at least if the player is equipped with a firearm. Which may
be desirable - an attack pattern like this could be used to make an other-
wise deadly monster less dangerous, to justify its use earlier in the game
than it would normally appear.

A related topic is the question of changing statistics. A flying creature
with a circular attack pattern, as described above, could justifiably be
faster and/or harder to hit while circling, than when closing in for the
kill. (This would also give it back some of the lethality it lost to the
increased attack interval.) I can almost hear Jakub groaning as he thinks
of all the changes this would require in the code. ^_^;

[Machine-Ghost:]
> Could it pass through walls, too?
>
What IS it with you and walls? O_o Here, too, I wouldn't necessarily let
them pass through walls, since both the hologram and the force field would
realistically require the respective projector to have a line-of-sight to
where the creature is. Not that such things should matter much during
gameplay; I certainly don't recommend placing a "projector" somewhere on
the screen and limiting the Ghosts' movement accordingly (though it could
make this another interesting "hive" creature). But, as projected images,
the Ghosts could very well "teleport" from place to place, just by re-

THE best story HPL ever wrote, btw, if you went and asked me. Alas, no,
no starfish here; besides, the Elder Things had no eyes. (The description

Star Frontiers.)

More parallel development. My "Razor-bat" made fly-by attacks with sharp

That's a fantastically creepy detail about the "hive" or "queen" being a
living creature in its own right. Takes the word "alien" and smacks you in
the face with it.

Or just an effect of the ordinary reconstructing pill. They're rare enough

instead of getting a health boost.

There's just so much to say, I have to get this one going and continue in

I'll still have to think about implants, and how to implement them.
I plan to use energy just as bullets are used. Player will have a
whole "package" of energy points in cells and active tools will
consume them on load.

150 EP in Class A Cell
200 EP in Plasma Cell (there will be different types of energy)
etc.

Some weapons (and tools?) will auto regenerate the energy, but it
won't be possible to take out this energy (there are no food in
Xenocide and after a while player could store a lot). I don't want to
have any containers for energy. It will complicate as game as an implementation.

Such technical descriptions will be good for... descriptions :)
I really don't care (making this game) how futuristic, alien weapons
will work. They just will work and need cool names and effects.

IMHO roguelike games are about tactics. Roguelike game is a tactical
game, where you have only one person in your team and using available
tools, possibilites and features you have to survive.

I like it in Crawl - you need a lot of differnt potions before you'll
start to play with unidentified ones. There's a chance that potions
will poison you, rott you, paralyze you. You'll need to use a cure
then. It's fun.

It would... I still think how to make medic more worth to play.

I agree completely. Moreover this is a game - it doesn't have to be
realistic simulation. The game need rules that make game fun.
Look at the Tetris - a game, very simple one, but so fun! I love small fun
games like Destruction Carnival, Gearbolt Rage, Warning Forever, N
(hard to find because of name, so the link:
http://www.harveycartel.org/metanet/n.html), Lode Runner, Archon,
M.U.L.E and much more (I'm a big fan of 8 bit games). These games
aren't realistic, but are fun to play, just as I'd like my Xenocide
to be. Games aren't about realism, especially roguelike games aren't
like that. Games are for fun. How a letter moving on the screen can be
realistic? ;) Simulations are good for FPP games.

I like old-school weapons in Xenocide. Why? I don't know, I just like
them. It reminds me a feel of SF movies of eighties - Alien, Predator,
The Thing and other, I've grown with. There weren't any plasma guns
and phasers from Star Trek.

Player will - of course - find more advanced weapons in Enemy Bunker,
but won't have them on the beginning. Why there aren't? Maybe wars on
Earth ended when human race touched the stars? Maybe humans found that
such weapons are useless and began to produce only spaceship weapons
and planetary bombs? Who knows.

Thanks a lot for monsters - I really need them to make game fun.
Teoutons I had in mind were from a great book "I, Gelerth" (PL, probably
not translated into any other langaunge) by Pasikowski.
It's a postapocaliptic vision of the world, where human race have been
almost elimanted, and a group of soldiers (Soldiers of Round Table) is
living the castle, trying to survive and find a "Monolith", mystery
artifact that probably don't exist and no one even knows what it can
be. These soldiers are organised into similar hierarchy to the one
from legend of King Arthur (seeking for Holy Grail).

And there are Teutons, that are legend. No one saw them, well... no
one survived meeting. These Teutons are soldiers with super laser
weapons, power armors etc. No one ever killed any, and some people say
that "third world war" began by Russians, and they are
super-geneticaly modified russian soldiers, prepared to live in that
world.

The book is very brutal, but great. In the book Teutons were really
a human-like race, that was affraid of... Stephen Hawking.
He thought up the formula that describes universe and allows to change it.
Teoutons came to Earth, looking almost like humans they began a 3rd WW.
They couldn't destroy the whole planet - they weren't alone in the
Galaxy.
The story looks pitiful, but, well... Pasikowski is better writer than
I'm and he made this story interesting to read.

In Xeno will be Teutons, in power armors, that explodes on their
death, with laser weapons in hands and with some deadly grenades.
Proffesional killers. That's all.

Conclusion...
Thanks for your discussions. They are very interesting and I read every
e-mail. I regret that I don't have more time to discuss.
Next week I'll be absent too - after wasting time on the beach with
girlfriend ;) it's time to climb a bit in Italy.
Why don't I have two lives to share them among everything I'd like
to... :/


regards,
Jakub

Hm... It would be interesting to have both a fast-firing railgun and a large 
sort of "sniper" rail gun that is really, really huge and that can send 
really, really heavy objects flying at a target. Only it would be large, heavy, and 
have a smaller magazine.
 
Also, we should keep in mind that in the future scientists may have figured 
out better ways to magnetise said rails, meaning that heavier objects could be 
launched. I still like the idea of a needle gun, though. It sounds like an 
assassin's dream weapon.
 
>Another solution would be to include a dedicated power source with each

The same way powder is integrated into a bullet cartridge? Sounds like a good 
idea. But wouldn't it be better to have the rails constantly charged? Maybe 
the gun itself has a big battery that almost never runs out, and that can be 
replaced easily. Of course, Jakub can ignore the battery thing, if he wants. 
Real guns need to be cleaned regularly, but we don't see that happening in 
Xenocide, so maybe the battery that powers the rails can just be ignored as well.

>By the way, if we don't mind bending the laws of physics "a little,"
 
A little? Go for a lot! Our motto should be "we put the fiction in science 
fiction!" :)

This sounds interesting really interesting. Though it would probably serve as 
a late game sort of weapon.

True, true. I think that it is possible to implement them correctly, though. 
They should not be common, and certainly not quite on the same scale as 
good-old Cthulhu. Maybe one of his smaller, lesser cousins? Perhaps it has its own 
shadow filled level, with lots of fog and mist, and its always chitterling and 
squealing from out the darkness. And then, suddenly, it leaps out of the 
blackness, and the player shoots at it. The being retreats to heal itself, but the 
player is so shaken by the creature's sheer hideousness and noneuclidianness 
that he starts to go crazy.

I looked over a few of the comics. That's some pretty funny stuff. I'll have 
to read more. Now, I'll direct YOUR attention here:
 
http://www.hello-cthulhu.com/
 
Truly, truly horrifying.
 
>Going for the Understatement of the Year prize, are we?
 
Well, at least the guys in the movies know how to hold the guns right...
 
Sometimes :(

>[snip]
>
>What else?
 
Well, Antti, I think you got most of them. Here are a few more ones. Some are 
pretty unlikely, though...
 
For low skill with weapons:
 
If the player is trying to switch fire modes, or turn off the safety on a 
gun, and he REALLY doesn't know what he's doing, he could end up disassembling 
it...
 
The player might hold the butt of his rifle on his cheek (trying to aim) and 
end up getting his cheek bone shattered.
 
For grenades, the player might end up detonating the grenade in his own 
hands, or fumbling it and blowing himself up.
 
Now, some idiot might not know how to unload his gun, especially in the case 
of battery powered LASERs. And what if the player tries to compensate for the 
recoil from a railgun... only there's no recoil? Well, maybe as a one time 
thing anyway.
 
NOTE: These would be easier to do if there was an actual clip system, where 
one had to load bullets into the clip, and then load the clip into the gun. 
Come to think of it, that would add a new dimension to the gameplay, requiring 
the player to plan ahead on how he's going to distribute his ammo.
 
For low strength with weapons:
 
If he doesn't have a good grip on his gun, and it's a powerful one, it could 
fly from his hand, or send him flying backwards (if he's really weak). (This 
one could apply partially to skill, too)
 
He can't lift the gun off of the ground (especially for big guns like the 
minigun)
 
He can't adequately compensate for recoil
 
Gee, these are hard to think of. There are only so many things even an idiot 
can do wrong, short of holding the gun backwards and shooting himself.
 
If I think of any more, I'll send them in.
 
God Bless,

Of course, Jakub can ignore the battery thing, if he wants. Real guns need to be cleaned regularly, but we don't see that happening in Xenocide, so maybe the battery that powers the rails can just be ignored as well.</FONT></SPAN></P>

I'm just going to reply to everything at once in one email, because my head=

Your SpamAssassin must be biased against us Yanks.
=20
This means war! [ <--- My pathetic attempt at humour ]
=20
But seriously...
=20
I had kind of suspected that you weren't getting my emails, Antti, since yo=
u=20
weren't replying to anything I said. But I dismissed it as me being overly=
=20
paranoid. I should have know that your SpamAssassin was out to get me...

=20
Yes, "splitted" is not a word. @#$%ing overly complex English language...

Perhaps this 'splitter' is a giant amoeba like creature that splits apart=20
when killed? The creature is finally killed when so many of its cells have =
been=20
destroyed that it can no longer function as a single organism? (Not necessa=
rily=20
good science, but...)

>Which also brings to mind... Stephen, what's your intuition? Can the word
>"corpse" be used for animal bodies? My dictionary defines it as "a dead
>body, especially human." A "carcass" is "the body of a dead animal."
=20
Well, the word 'corpse' is almost always used exclusively in reference towa=
rd=20
a human's earthly remains. Carcass would definitely be more appropriate for=
=20
animals, though I don't think anyone would complain if Jakub uses 'corpse' =
in=20
reference to an animal. I think that in "ADOM" all dead monsters are referr=
ed=20
to as corpses. But Carcass would still be more accurate for animals.
=20
>Then again, a more pressing matter might be those personal pronouns - as i=
n
>"...damaging HIS Leather Jacket, killing IT."
=20
I noticed this, too. It is "his" jacket, but he is an "it" when he dies. A=
=20
system that assigns monsters genders would be helpful in this regard.
=20
I personally think that it would be better to rework the entire combat=20
message system. For example, instead of:
=20
 "You fire. Nail hits Crazy Citizen, damaging his leather jacket for one=20
damage. Nail hits Crazy Citizen, damaging his leather jacket killing it."
=20
...the sentence would read:
=20
"You fire your Nail Gun. Your nail hits the crazy citizen, punching through=
=20
his leather jacket, inflicting 1 point of damage. Your shot hits the crazy=
=20
citizen, punching through his leather jacket and killing him."
=20
I just think that that flows a lot better.

>Bloody complicated English language.
=20
I know the feeling :)

>ROCK MONSTER: A scraping mass of rocks and boulders, held together and

Interesting, though it sounds like it should be a monster found later in th=
e=20
game. Maybe in the "underground" area beneath the bunker?

=20
Now that sounds nasty :)
=20
The sonic attacks would be focused, I presume. Once again, I would say that=
=20
this sounds like it belongs later in the game.
=20
Maybe you could call it a "sonic-sack"? :)
=20
Seriously, though, what about "vocomorph" (from Latin vox, voice, and Greek=
=20
morph, form)? It's a life-"form" that attacks with its "voice".

=20
But would it be invisible from a distance? Or would it flicker back and for=

between visibility and invisibility?

Now this has interesting gameplay possibilities. Could it grab the player i=
n=20
from afar, using its tentacles as a sort of "organic tractor beam (for lack=

a better analogy)"?
=20

>Talsorian's excellent "Mekton Empire" RPG sourcebook...]
=20
A new name, eh? What about "Dimensiomorph"? It sounds interesting. Almost=20
like a super-jelly fish. Can it pass through walls?
=20
>FROSTBITE: A native of colder climes, this furry beast secretes a chemical

Freezing... That ads a whole new element of gameplay possibilities. Can the=
=20
monster freeze the floor, allowing the playing to slip and fall?

>SLITHER: A segmented, snake-like creature with crablike claws set just
>behind its head. It can spit poison to blind targets.


Poison spitting is always interesting. But would it be more of an 'acidic=20
poison', that corrodes, or a venomous poison?

>DRAGONWORM: A distant relation of the Slither, this small winged serpent
>has a scaly body and wings that allow flight almost as agile as a dragon-

It sounds annoying, like a kind of hit and run monster. How strong or weak=

would this beast be? And I would hope that its not too large or powerful...

So would you use energy based weapons to short circuit it? I like the idea.=
..=20
Could it pass through walls, too?

Barrel-shaped, with tentacles on the top and the bottom? Hm... If it had=20
wings, it would sound almost like one of H.P. Lovecraft's "Elder Things" fr=
om "At=20
the Mountains of Madness".
=20
Sorry, but I'm at a loss for naming it.

=20
It sounds kind of like the "Greater Hellbeast" in Zangband.
=20
Anyway, nice ideas, Antti. Nice, terrifying, disturbing ideas :)
=20
Now that the topic of monster ideas comes up, I do have a few of my own to=
=20
throw into the mix. Keep in mind that these aren't monster descriptions to =
be=20
used in the game, just general summaries of what the creatures would be lik=
e in=20
terms of gameplay.
=20
GENETIC LAB
-----------
=20
ABOMINATION: Found on the last level of the lab. A hideous, writhing mass o=
f=20
spliced DNAs, it resembles nothing the player has ever seen. It exists only=
 to=20
eat, and it is omnivorous.
=20
MUTANT GENETICIST: What if at the end of the Genetic Lab there is a unique=
=20
"boss" type monster? Maybe the scientist who was experimenting on all those=
=20
creatures ended up mortally wounded by his own creations, and he fused hims=
elf=20
with various DNAs to survive. By doing this, however, he ended up as a giga=
ntic,=20
hideously deformed sort of super-mutant, and now the player must kill him, =
or=20
be killed. Perhaps the mutant geneticist has some sort of item in his=20
inventory that the player can use to upgrade his stats?
=20
MINES
-----
=20
DARKLING BAT: A small sort of "bat-like" creature (though it is more of a=20
cross between a lizard and an insect than a mammal). It moves rather quickl=
y, and=20
navigates by way of an organic sonar-radar. The creature is capable of=20
emitting a highly focused sonic attack that, though weak, can sometimes stu=
n the=20
player.
=20
PSYMOULD: A fungoid growth found in dark, damp places (such as the mines). =
It=20
doesn't move, but it uses its psychic powers to feast on the brain-waves of=
=20
nearby organisms. This eventually kills the organisms, but that goes withou=
t=20
saying. Easy enough to kill, but it can sap life from a distance. (Maybe it=
=20
could even drain intelligence... Or is that too powerful for so early in th=
e game).
=20
ROTTWORM: Small social worm-like creatures that are easy to kill but often=
=20
found in large numbers due to the...
=20
ROTTWORM HIVE: A hive from which rottworms are spawned. It is actually one=
=20
giant rottworm, in which other rottworms live, and acts much like a "rottwo=
rm=20
queen", spawning more and more rottworms. Unfortunately for the hive (but=20
fortunately for the player) it is immobile, and lacks its own defence syste=
m. This=20
would probably be a somewhat rare enemy.
=20
That's all I have so far. I'll try to think of more in the near future.
=20
>All that said, let's not forget that this is a /game/. Perhaps the best
>conclusion that can be drawn from the rant above is that whatever Jakub
>feels works best for his game, it can be rationalised by spouting enough
>techno-babble. ^_^; (Hey, it works for Star Trek.)
=20
Techno-babble, you say?...
=20
"The micro-particle nanites use advanced molecular nano-forming techniques =
to=20
reconstruct damaged organic tissue. Using their picoconductor power cores,=
=20
they are able to channel and redirect the ambient energy found in an organi=
sm's=20
own blood stream, converting it into the quasi-electrical energy that they =
use=20
to power their own dynamcells, thus recharging themselves."
=20

=20

>some relatively simple solution for restoring your statistics.)
=20
Well, my original idea was for a kind of super-rare, almost permanent slow=
=20
acting "poison" type of pill.... But I like your idea better :)
=20
I think that it should be very slow-acting, and that it should last for a=20
while, but that it should be easy enough to remove, using a fairly common i=
tem=20
(maybe an advanced nano reconstructing pill that defeats harmful nanites?).
=20
>Also, how about a "radiation poison?" (It looked like a pill, but was in=20
fact a lump
>of Uranium 235! +_+) Or an *actual* drug - say, a hallucinogen? "Look at
>all those pretty colours!"
=20
I personally like the idea for a hallucination system. The player could go=
=20
through a variety of stages of hallucinations, from being slightly drugged=
=20
(colours change, enemies have strange descriptions) , to being completely l=
ost in=20
his own delusional world (enemies appear to be horrible nightmare monsters=
=20
[even simple claw rats], enemies appear to be where there are no enemies, d=
oors=20
appear where there are no doors, and you can't open them, the player can se=
e=20
himself, the player can leave a trail of other 'players' behind him as he w=
alks,=20
the player enters a new level and it looks just like the fiery bowels of he=
ll,=20
all of the monsters appear to be from the wrong genre [e.g. fantasy Dragons=
,=20
Trolls, Ogres], strange messages are displayed ["You hear a cacophony of=20
pained screams and agonised wails coming from inside the walls!, "A strange=
 and=20
terrible voice speaks into your mind: '{Player's name}... Death... Blood...=
=20
{Player's name}... '", "You feel something brush against the back of your n=
eck",=20
"You feel the earth shake underneath you, as if some titanic monstrosity ha=
d=20
just burst free from its aeon long slumber at the centre of the world"]).
=20
I think it would be interesting if certain enemies could drive the player=20
insane, either through psychic powers or through just being too horrible to=
 even=20
look at. Then the player could hallucinate, and he wouldn't know what was=20
going on! Hmm... Maybe certain hallucinations should mimic real in game eve=
nts (if=20
there's a powerful monster than announces its presence by going=20
"Aaaaaaaaaaooooooooooooooowr!" then maybe a crazy player would occasionally=
 hear the=20
monster's cry, causing him to grow paranoid.
=20
Sorry if I just go on and on and on about these hallucinations, but I just=
=20
think that it's a great idea.
=20

=20
Well, maybe a "chemical analyser" device that can tell the player what kind=
s=20
of pills do what. But maybe this device has a very limited battery? Or mayb=
e=20
its a kind of disposable use-and-discard kind of item? Or perhaps this mach=

require a bit of technical knowledge to operate correctly, so the player wo=

have to have med-skills?
=20
Speaking of scanners, what about a 'tricorder' kind of device that can scan=
=20
enemies and give additional information on them? Just a thought.

=20
Here's a list of possible mutations I have thought up... (None of them are=
=20
very realistic. Think the "X-Men"...)
=20
* Growing gills
* Hardened Scales that act as a natural armour
* Infra-vision
* Super hearing (like a sort of sonar-radar)
* The power to use a limited psychic attack
* The power to eat monster carcasses to regain health
* Heat and/or cold resistance
* Simple stat upgrades
* Growing sharp, claw-like nails
* Being able to breath a poison cloud
* Being able to spit a glob of acid
* Being able to emit a high-pitched stunning shriek
* Poison immunity
* Always fast
* Always slow (they can't be all good)
* Night-vision
* The player gains super-muscles, but he begins to move slowly
* The player can psychically sense the minds of intelligent enemies
* The player can emit small blasts of electricity
* The player can emit weak magnetic fields to destroy robots
* The player gains the psychic power to move distant objects into his hand
=20
>This reminded me of a very important thing: no matter what the world is=20
_likely_ to be
>like in the future, well, it's the future, so anything *could* happen!
=20
True. Anything could happen in the future. In fact, one of my favourite TV=
=20
shows of all time takes place in the year 2076... And everyone still uses=20
contemporary firearms, because weapons development ceased after the moon wa=
s blown=20
up...
=20
But that's another story. But you are right, weapons in the future could be=
=20
similar to those of today, especially if the firearm developers don't want =
to=20
give up control of the military industry. Xenocide takes place in a world w=
ith=20
super-powered corporations, right? So maybe these corporations still pushed=
=20
regular firearms, while still developing more advanced weapons. Maybe civil=
ians=20
are only allowed to own firearms, while the military is allowed to own=20
railguns, LASER guns and plasma guns.
=20
Well, I sure have written a lot. Just a few more thoughts.
=20
The game is much more balanced now, until I get to the mines or the lab,=20
where I promptly die. Usually because of lack of ammo, or maybe lack of a g=
ood=20
armour.
=20
Jakub, I saw the smoke in the mines. I thought it was from a grenade droppe=
d=20
by an enemy. Maybe you should change it to "mist" or "a strange mist) inste=
ad=20
of smoke. It sounds more eerie.
=20
You do do great with the flavour items, though, Jakub. Especially in the=20
spaceship, with all those human remains lying around...
=20
And yes, we need sandworms. The more we steal from other sci-fi sources lik=
e=20
Dune, the better, because we have to do less work. Well, Jakub still has to=
 do=20
work, he programs it, but we idea people don't have to do much work. We=20
already have super-powered corporations ala "Blade Runner" and "Aliens". No=
w all we=20
need are phasers (from Star Trek) the Force (from Star Wars) vorlons (from=
=20
Babylon 5) and an Infinite Improbability Generator :)
=20
But seriously, I'm not a big fan of clich=E9s, which is why I didn't put=20
"hyperspace" in the Xenocide story. Everyone uses "hyperspace". I switched =
it=20
around. Instead of the ship moving through a different kind of space, the s=
hip=20
changes into a completely different form of matter, which can far exceed th=
e speed=20
of light without braking any of the rules of physics. To quote the=20
hyper-driver user's manual...
=20
"The GenTech HR-52ccD12 hyper-drive is what transforms the matter of modern=
=20
spacecrafts into hyper-matter, making it capable of travelling at super-lum=
inal=20
speeds. The hyper-drive does this by generating a quasi-particle field of=20
anti-neutrinos, and then retroverting them into its hyper-dynamic fluctuato=
r via=20
magnetic tractor waves, which fuses them into its dynamcore. This generates=
 a=20
hyper-temporal ultratron field, which rapidly expands, encompassing the who=
le=20
of the ship and accelerating the ship's matter on a sub-atomic level. The=20
ship's electrons begin to orbit their nucleuses at faster than light speeds=
,=20
causing a quantum-enhancement of the protons and neutrons, allowing them to=
=20
transcend the laws that confine normal matter and accelerate beyond the spe=
ed of=20
light."
=20
Techno-babble at its best :)
=20
Ugh, I've written a lot, and I'll hopefully write more soon. And, damn,=20
there's another mail form Antti in my inbox that I'll have to reply to :)
=20
But for now I have to go.
=20
God Bless,

Perhaps the most important things to remember about lasers (real life
lasers, that is - fictional lasers can do whatever you feel you can get
away with) are that (1) the beam is invisible unless refracted by smoke,
and silent (though some sources postulate a line of sparks from ionised
air, and a sharp crack as air rushes in to fill the vacuum created by
the beam), and (2) the wounds caused are not likely to be cauterised
surface burns, but a burst of vapour and chunks of flesh IN THE DIRECTION
OF THE FIRER, as the transmitted heat energy vapourises the water in the
body.

> A railgun is a weapon that uses two electromagnetic rails

Two or more. Seldom more than four, however. I have also seen a design
where a single coil ran down the length of the barrel in a spiral or
"spring" pattern, and as a magnetic pulse was sent down the coil it took
the projectile with it.

> Railguns fire solid projectiles, much like modern conventional guns.
>
...But the projectiles tend to be smaller and lighter, both to reduce the
amount of energy required to accelerate them, and to increase penetration.
This does reduce the range somewhat (as lighter projectiles are more
susceptible to environmental effects), but it's not so much of a problem
as high muzzle velocity compensates for a lot.

Railguns can also attain horrendous rates of fire, as there is no friction
between the projectile and the barrel (to cause the barrel to heat, and
require a cool-down period). A "typical" personal railgun therefore, might
be a longarm firing very small-calibre needles from a heavy, high-capacity
clip - at several thousand shots per minute. Ouch.

> could eventually run out of power, unless the battery inside of it was
>
Another solution would be to include a dedicated power source with each
magazine, containing just enough power to fire all the projectiles (and
then some, to allow a safety margin).

By the way, if we don't mind bending the laws of physics "a little," there
could be a specific protection from ferromagnetic railgun projectiles...
a magnetic protective field.

As for plasma weapons, the points Steve made were very, very good and the
only thing I can add is that a "beam gun" might actually be the form a
plasma weapon was MOST likely to take (possibly apart from one that fires
physical "plasma cartridges"), given that it would "only" need to project
a tubular containment field to the target and then send the plasma down it.

Oh, I see! A wireless taser! Yes, I wasn't aware of this thing. Looks
interesting. (In fact, this is exactly what was called an "electrolaser"
in "GURPS Ultra-Tech".)

This also brings to mind another energy weapon type I had been meaning to
suggest - particle beam weapons. They work by magnetically accelerating
charged subatomic particles to relativistic speeds, then directing them at
a target. When this "bolt" hits, it deposits its energy, causing a surface
explosion, as well as some electromagnetic radiation that can scramble
electronics. In RL, particle beams have been in development longer than
lasers, and I understand the Russians experimented with one (a big one,
mounted on an aircraft carrier).

^_^ This is unlikely. Not only would the armour have to be ferromagnetic
(they just don't make too much IRON armour these days), the amount of
energy required to knock back an adult human being /in armour/ (or even
to give him a noticeable shove) would be so great that the person inside
would be dead from shock before the suit moved.
Not that it wouldn't be fun to just make it do that... and look good while
doing it.

Or how about typing "C:\>TYPE NECRONOMICON.TXT" into the Genetic Machine?
But seriously, Lovecraftian horrors are a difficult addition to implement.
Horror requires care to do right, and if Great Cthulhu was nothing but a
really big monster to be shot into itty-bitty bits of goo, the effect would
simply be ridiculous. And that would be a shame.

There was a fun table in "GURPS Horror" for randomly determining the

Lovecraftian spirit, "Indescribable (stop rolling)". :D

A propos, I would also like to direct your attention to the UNSPEAKABLE
VAULT (of Doom) at <www.macguff.fr/goomi/unspeakable/home.html>. You won't
regret it. (Though I won't accept responsibility for any loss of sanity.)

The advantages of such a weapon would be rather questionable. The surprise
and the sudden weightlessness might disorientate him for a while, but in
the case of experienced soldiers (or spacers!), there are no guarantees.
A more likely use would be to smash him against the ceiling (or drop him
from a height)... and then, it would be just another gun: point it at the
adversary, pull the trigger, and he'll take damage.
(Well, such wholesale kinetic damage would _probably_ be less affected by
heavy armour, and at the very least, the target is likely to be somewhat
shaken... literally!)

Going for the Understatement of the Year prize, are we? <g> I could list
half a dozen things about guns that have _never_ been portrayed accurately
in _any_ movie. But not here. (Myself, I have the dubious honour - for a
pacifist - of having served in the armed forces - as we have a draft-based
military in Finland - so I do have some first-hand experience with assault
rifles, machine guns... and anti-aircraft artillery.) And the things Steve
mentioned about switching fire modes, bracing for recoil and so on were
all quite true. My original point was against preventing the player from
even trying to use an unfamiliar gun.

While we're on the subject, let's systematically list some mishaps that
can occur when using an unfamiliar firearm without the requisite skill,
for Jakub's possible benefit...

- Misalign the sights, accuracy decreased
- Accidentally release the clip
- The recoil hurts your shoulder
- The recoil throws all shots off target
- Overcompensate for recoil, miss target (even vets sometimes do this)
- Cannot switch fire mode (stuck at whatever it was when found) - it would
 be even more fun to have the fire mode selection be random every time the
 player TRIES to change it, but with only three to select from at most, it
 is something of a moot point
- Accidentally switch fire mode
- Cannot find the safety catch (a classic)
- Shoot yourself in the foot
- Weapon jams (and you don't know how to clear it)
- "Gangfire" in the magazine (admittedly unlikely, but it can sometimes
 happen if you try to fire a jammed gun - especially an experimental one)
- For energy weapons: loss of power (damage decreased), misalign focussing
 array (range reduced), overheats and blows up

What else?

It seems that I'm badly behind in reacting to other people's emails
(as I never received them in the first place), so I might as well get
started.

Very true, and ultimately up to Jakub. This is one of the greatest problems
facing people who design real-life cybernetics today. There have been a few
suggestions how to power implants, and none are quite satisfactory (at
least for the more powerful uses). Ordinary lead-acid batteries are not
only heavy, but also dangerous if damaged. And that goes double for many
more advanced types, like atomic batteries (would you really want fission-
able materials inside your body?). A lot of exotic solutions have been
proposed (including flywheels and miniature turbines in the bloodstream!),
but most cannot provide enough power to run all the systems required for a
useful implant. A rechargeable or replaceable power cell of some description
would probably be the most likely solution, though they have the annoying
tendency to run out at precisely the wrong moment... But rechargeable
implants give rise to an evil idea for another implant - a "bioconvertor".
Recharge your batteries by biting your enemies in the neck!

All that said, let's not forget that this is a /game/. Perhaps the best
conclusion that can be drawn from the rant above is that whatever Jakub
feels works best for his game, it can be rationalised by spouting enough
techno-babble. ^_^; (Hey, it works for Star Trek.)

> Also, what about a sub-dermal cloaking device? And...

A whole lot of cool ideas! Jakub, take note!

But this would simply be an interesting description for a run-of-the-mill
poisoning... IF all it does is deal you HP damage. BUT if it's really
tearing you apart from the inside, this one could actually reduce your
statistics, making it one bugger of a hazard. (And therefore, would have
to be limited somehow, such as making the duration very short or allowing
some relatively simple solution for restoring your statistics.) Also, how
about a "radiation poison?" (It looked like a pill, but was in fact a lump
of Uranium 235! +_+) Or an *actual* drug - say, a hallucinogen? "Look at
all those pretty colours!"

In general, the point here is, I think, that drugs should come in both
varieties - harmful as well as beneficial. In real life, it's always a
risk taking an unknown pill (though IMO the "good" ones should heavily
outnumber the "bad" ones - because nobody likes to get killed just because
in a moment of weakness, they swallowed some deadly poison on the off
chance it might be a healing drug). However, in fantasy games, there is
always some way to identify unknown items. Here, we could have an item -
a "Medscanner"? - that would tell you what a given drug does... as long
as it is running. (But would that take away too much of the advantage of
playing a Medic?)

> Or maybe a 'mutation' pill (similar to the potions of mutation in crawl)
>
Hey, this one would be really easy to implement. (He says 'cuz he doesn't
have to /program/ it.) Just take a random creature type and call the
Genetic Machine routine. Oh yes! This is one that we HAVE to get to see
in the game! ("You have swallowed a mutogenic drug! Hang on!")

I'll leave the discussion about weapons for another mail - it's going to
be a thick one. For a teaser, I'll mention this about technology: This
past weekend, I took some time to refresh my memories of a truly remarkable
computer game from the '90s: Flashback (by Delphine Software). Other
considerations aside, it used a very distinctive graphics style reminiscent
of European sci-fi comics - the likes of Valrian (available in the States
as "Linda and Valentin" - if at all) or some of Moebius' less wild stuff,
and perhaps also Enki Bilal. An integral part of this style is the runaway
use of highly anachronistic technology. It had ray-emitting machines, anti-
gravity applications and teleportation devices galore - yet the protagonist
wore an ordinary leather jacket and carried a gun that actually spat out
cartridge cases, and the society portrayed was a relatively contemporary
one. It was historically unlikely, but as a whole it WORKED. This reminded
me of a very important thing: no matter what the world is _likely_ to be
like in the future, well, it's the future, so anything *could* happen!

I plan to add some "bosses" in the game - a great polyp in the bottom
of caves, that take a fourth part of map, 
a giant robot where you see only his feet on the ground etc.
Sand worms - no, no, without freemens :) Just a monsters that can hide
in the sand when wounded.

Such flying vehicles would be to hard to implement...
But I'm not discarding that idea. We will see...

Should be fixed.

Nowhere. It's a kind of gas/smoke that appears from small holes in the
walls/floor/ceiling. Just to be scary :) It creates a impression that
something can hide in the smoke, you know, like in horror movies.

Yes, I know. For now - there aren't any effects for that smoke. Maybe
this smoke will explode with contact with fire? A good idea.
Have you found that ceiling can collapse, where cantilevers are?

The place where smoke was is erased, because the game remembers the
last visible tile and there was a feeling, that smoke is still in the
place that player saw. That was ugly.

Splitter splits on his dead. Two new that appear have HP equal HP/2-3
and half of experience for kill.

That's good. Be active as much as you can! All the ideas are
appreciated :)

we have a SpamAssasin on mail server in our company, but it's well
"trained" and there weren't false positives so far.

Well... I think I'll have to check yahoo sometimes.


regarding bugs you mentioned:

really? It's should be fixed now.
Maybe I haven't uploaded the newest version?
Try the new version - it has a few fixes and this bug is fixed for
sure.
http://www.roguelikedevelopment.org/graveyard/files/xeno_test.zip

> - It still lists two motive systems of the same type on robots with two
>  different types of motive system.

hm... was fixed too...

> - It still displays an action and any consequences of that action (such as
>  drug effects or poisoning) in reverse order.

it still has to be fixed.

it happens sometimes, when "slowing" is too small to affect stats.
I'll fix that.

I think I have to rewrite messaging system... It's a bit too complicated
and it's hard to keep right order of messages.

Pills are small ;)

Thanks for your comments. I've read all the emails and will answer soon.

Welcome back, Jakub! I think you'll find quite a lot to digest here... ^_^;

Hmmm. I hope none of you are using SpamAssassin to filter your list mails.
The university is, and I just realised that it had blocked one of my list
mails (the copy that returned to me) as spam. Commendable vigilance, to be
sure. Either that or a wicked sense of humour.

Wait wait wait! Stop press! I just visited the Yahoogroups site, and found
a whole slew of mails from Stephen that I had never seen in my inbox! Those
sent by Jakub (and myself) made it to me without trouble (aside from the one
mentioned above). The first thing I'll do is check the SpamAssassin settings
- I think it's the most likely culprit here as well...

Hello List :)

I had some holidays last week (have been to Croatia), so I coudn't
participate in discussion.
I promise to read all the letters as soon as possible.

Jakub

Yes, I finally came up with a couple of new monsters. But first, a couple
of things that came to mind.

Something needs to be done about the Splitter - a cool creature in itself
- as evidenced by the in-game message "Splitted Splitter splits!" For one,
the past participle of "split" is the irregular "split", so it should in
fact read "Split Splitter". A new name wouldn't hurt, either...
(An idea: the Splitter could be described as a micro-organism or bacteria-
based "mass lifeform", with some sort of group consciousness that gets
smarter the more there are. How's "the Biotic" for a name?)

Of course, micro-organisms (OR invertebrates, such as LEECHES...) should
not leave skeletons... No, Jakub, we're not here specifically to make your
life difficult...

Which also brings to mind... Stephen, what's your intuition? Can the word
"corpse" be used for animal bodies? My dictionary defines it as "a dead
body, especially human." A "carcass" is "the body of a dead animal." Then
again, a more pressing matter might be those personal pronouns - as in
"...damaging HIS Leather Jacket, killing IT."

Bloody complicated English language.

Anyway, on with the critters.

ROCK MONSTER: A scraping mass of rocks and boulders, held together and
given a vaguely humanoid shape by a projected force field. Strong, massive
and nigh-impossible to bring down.

?: It doesn't look dangerous. It's just a sack of flesh with two clumsy
limbs it uses to drag its weight along, and a fleshy fold near the bottom
for a mouth. But it can emit a powerful, high-pitched sound that can
shatter bones and liquefy tissue for consumption.

PROTOPLASM: One of the more repulsive mutants so far, this one is hard to
recognise as formerly human. It is almost completely transparent, and
mostly jellified as well; internal organs can be seen floating around
inside it.

SKINSTEALER: This amorphous mass of mobile slime has developed a unique
way to get close to its prey: it deftly flays its victims and then oozes
inside the skin, becoming a shambling mockery of the original creature.

GARGANTUAN: A ten-metre-tall silver tree with clusters of tentacles
surrounding a mouth in its upper part. Each of the tentacles can lash
out, individually or in groups, to grab prey and pull it into the mouth.

KIRINI: A hovering sphere of seething tentacles that produces odd sounds
when the tentacles rub together. It has been theorised that this may merely
be the three-dimensional part of a multi-dimensional being, which may well
be the case, as its touch has destructive qualities similar to a matter/
antimatter reaction.
[This one needs a new name, as it was lifted almost-as-is from R.
Talsorian's excellent "Mekton Empire" RPG sourcebook...]

FROSTBITE: A native of colder climes, this furry beast secretes a chemical
compound with a high freezing point which it can exhale, rendering its prey
immobile or at least causing great shock and tissue damage.

SLITHER: A segmented, snake-like creature with crablike claws set just
behind its head. It can spit poison to blind targets.

DRAGONWORM: A distant relation of the Slither, this small winged serpent
has a scaly body and wings that allow flight almost as agile as a dragon-
fly's.

MACHINE-GHOST: A computer-projected hologram that owes its solidity and
ability to affect the environment to projected force fields. Attacks tend
to pass right though, but the fields can be caused to overload.

?: Consisting of a barrel-shaped body with three eyes and three segmented
legs spaced evenly around it, short tentacles round the underside, and a
long, muscular tentacle growing out of the top, this one is a disturbing
sight. A scavenger, it's in its element in a carrion-rich environment like
this. It can swing the top tentacle, which ends in a knobbly ball, to fend
off competition.

CAVIOMORPH: A bundle of claws and dark fur, the solitary Caviomorph prefers
high places from which to pounce upon unwary prey. With powerful legs and
a sleek body, it is a silent, cunning killer.
[The ultimate trick monster, the Caviomorph is... a guinea pig. As everyone
who has ever owned one knows, they are anything but the things described
above. The name comes from caviomorpha, the disputed "third suborder" of
the order rodentia.]

I listed a couple of old "undocumented features" that I noticed are still
with us...

- It still lumps ordinary shotgun shells together with another type already
 in the inventory (newfound sharp and hi-acc shells are handled correctly).
- It still lists two motive systems of the same type on robots with two
 different types of motive system.
- It still displays an action and any consequences of that action (such as
 drug effects or poisoning) in reverse order.
- After a recent encounter with a Flying Leech (in which I took four slowing
 hits), I was shown as "Slow" on the game screen and "Paralyzed" on the
 character information screen; however, no reduction in the Speed
 characteristic was displayed, and I was able to act normally.
- Attack descriptions could use some punctuation. For a prime example (from
 an actual message log): "Nail hits Crazy Citizen, damaging his Leather
 Jacket killing it." A simple comma would do wonders after the armour
 degradation message, and would also separate HP damage to the wearer from
 the "armour damaged" message.
- Pills are easy to overlook when the floor they lie on happens to be the
 same colour!

An idea: now that we have plenty of unidentified stuff out there to be
found, shouldn't there also be a "Call" command, so common to many fantasy
Roguelikes (starting with Rogue itself)? Sometimes that pill you just popped
had no appreciable effect, but based on circumstance, you still know what
type it's likely to be. It would be handy to be able, then, to call it by
that name instead of "a pink pill".

Thank you for the complements, they are much appreciated. Especially since I 
haven't really taken the time to proof read the story and revise it like I 
should have...

Hm... I wonder, would it be possible to have some "Lovecraftian" monsters in 
Xenocide? You know, Cthulhu, Tsathoggua and their kin... Then the player would 
be able to go insane :)
 
Amorphous cosmic horrors always spice things up in terms of gameplay, at 
least IMHO, and they'd be real fun to write descriptions for.

>"Teutons"? Will they come complete with cool horned helmets and all? <g>


Hmm... Maybe a group of Teutonic Knights set out for the crusades and 
accidentally ended up walking into a space-time rift (or a "wormhole" as they have 
been called) and ended up on a planet filled with lots of alien technology, but 
no aliens?
 
Now that's just plain ludicrous :) [perhaps ludicrous enough to work...]

>[Re: gravitic weapons:] 


Let's not forget anti-gravity weapons, that send the enemy flying up into the 
air and make him float around for a while.

I sent something to the group about different weapon types... At least I 
think I did. And it's in my "Sent Mail" folder. Now I'm all confused :(

I second that statement, especially in terms of what can happen in a game 
like "Diablo". Like I said, I think that it's a good idea to make bad things 
happen to players who don't have high enough stats or skills. Especially for alien 
and highly technical weapons. The player could point the alien gun the wrong 
way, and end up blasting a hole in himself. Anyway...

True, but what if you don't know how to switch fire modes on the gun? Also, 
some guns are more difficult to use than others. For example, certain rifles 
have particularly powerful kickbacks, so that you could dislocate your shoulder 
if the gun's butt isn't pressed firmly against it. And you don't see that 
explained in a lot of movies, thus it is not generally common knowledge to most 
people (because most people, in my experience, get their knowledge of guns from 
movies and television, which aren't all that accurate).
 
Anyway, I've written enough for now. I do have some ideas concerning 
monsters, but I'll save those for another time.
 
God Bless,
 
   -Steve

Ahh, heck. I was going to analyse the story for all the implications of its
scale, both time and space, but then I realised that it was all so much idle
chatter about something that was never meant to be realistic. I'll leave it
at this: good job, Stephen! Nice story. Good narrative skills.

Now, about some things mentioned in and about "ideas.txt".

[Re: monsters:]
Well, the list certainly makes it plain just what kind of high weirdness
you can get away with in this game, so expect some more strange creature
descriptions your way soon, Jakub. ^_^

"Teutons"? Will they come complete with cool horned helmets and all? <g>

[Re: sonic weapons:]
As it happens, I researched the possibilities of sonic weapons last year
for a science fiction RPG I'm co-authoring, and read about the same (or
very similar) sonic device that Stephen described. The point about it was
that it was directional; unlike sound waves in general, this sound did not
expand in all directions at once (since it did not cause reverberations in
air, only on solid items). Thus, it solved (in theory, anyway) the problem
with sonic weapons: focussing.

Now, a sonic weapon can do a lot more than stun. We all know that sound
waves can shatter glass; in fact, since sound is nothing more than a shock
wave (essentially), properly tuned sound that is powerful enough can break
apart steel and tear the flesh off bones. The key is the words "properly
tuned". Basically, the correct frequency for causing damage varies from one
type of matter to the next, so sonic weapons would be likely to be pretty
specialised as to the type of target (even with advanced frequency adjust-
ment).

[Re: gravitic weapons:]
Gravity manipulation presents even greater problems than sonic weapons!
Basically, there are two types of "gravitic" weapons: ones that use some
sort of gravitic accelerator to accelerate a projectile (in other words,
a non-magnetic railgun), and ones that somehow project gravitic forces to
throw targets around or crush them under their own weight. (One word that
comes to mind is "ultra-advanced". ^_^ Given that humans still seem to be
using solid-propellant firearms in 2129, my advice would be to make these
a strictly alien, possibly relic, technology.) The latter type would
perhaps be slightly more believable as an (experimental?) grenade type.

[Re: ion, plasma, fusion, phaser, antimatter, improbabilium etc. weapons:]
Well, all kinds of names can be given to weapons, but if you can hold it
and shoot something with it, it's a gun. Care should be taken that weapons
are differentiated in more than name. This, of course, goes for gravitic
weapons as well.

Oops! almost forgot! Here's my two cents' worth (even though the smallest
euro coin in use in Finland is the five cent piece ^_^) on the subject of
skill/stat restrictions for weapon use. I don't like them. More generally,
I don't like restrictions of any kind; in real life, there's nothing
(except maybe the law) to stop a scrawny little fellow like myself from
picking up an AK-47 and spraying away on full automatic, though his fire
would certainly be more effective if he were a muscle-bound bruiser who
knew what he was doing. (But even a 7.62mm assault rifle IS quite control-
lable if you're properly braced.) So, I like Stephen's suggestion that
unexpected things happen when you try to use a weapon but aren't skilled
enough (such as accidentally emptying - or releasing - the entire magazine,
or dropping the weapon due to recoil, or causing the weapon to explode).
But such random events can be a pain to program.

I also cannot agree to Jakub's assertion that restrictions were necessary
in a game. (Few things are more ridiculous than "Diablo" telling me my
character, Strength 39, cannot use a Broad Sword, Strength requirement 40.)
What I imagine was meant by this was that the more advanced items are better
confined to the later stages of the game, where the challenges are similarly
greater. Well, there is a way to do that - make them (or their ammunition!)
only appear later on in the game! If a restriction is absolutely needed for
the bigger guns, why not introduce an invisible, weapon-type-specific
"familiarity modifier" that penalises your initial attempts to use a new-
found gun, but decreases gradually as you become more familiar with it (so
that eventually, you'll be using the laser pistol just as well as that other
Small Gun you've been training with since the beginning of the game)?
There's only so much difference between a rifle and a rifle, you know.

That's all for now. Come on, say something, you other people.

Salutations, everyone,
 
I had a few thoughts concerning Xenocide weapons, so I thought I'd share them.
 
Conventional firearms (e.g. explosive launch pistols and rifles) and 
explosives (e.g. grenades and missiles) are already common in both the real world and 
Xenocide, but there are other kinds of armaments that may exists in the near, 
intermediate or futures.
      Such weapons would include railguns, plasma weapons, ion guns, EMP 
weapons, LASER guns and sonic weapons. I've already sent Jakub some information on 
what I know about LASERs, and I've said some things about sonic weapons, but 
I'm also willing to share my knowledge of the other weapon types.
      I'm pretty sure that this is accurate information, though I don't have 
any degrees in physics, so if anyone has any corrections to make, feel free...
 
      [1] Railguns
 
A railgun is a weapon that uses two electromagnetic rails to launch a 
ferromagnetic object at a target. This means that a railgun can launch ferromagnetic 
bullets, or it can launch non-ferromagnetic bullets encased in ferromagnetic 
sabots.
      Railguns fire solid projectiles, much like modern conventional guns. 
They don't recoil with firing (the bullet never actually touches the rails, it 
hovers very close to them), and they tend to hurl projectiles at faster speeds 
than normal firearms. These two factors cause the bullets to travel along a 
much straighter path, causing railguns to be much more accurate than regular 
guns.
      Railguns would require both a projectile and a power source to 
electro-magnetically charge the rails. This means that a railgun could eventually run 
out of power, unless the battery inside of it was so powerful that it would 
take years to run out.
      If you so wish, Jakub, you could easily replace all of the normal guns 
in Xenocide with railguns. For example, a shotgun would be a wide barred 
railgun, loaded with steel sabots containing buckshot (or whatever kind of shot 
they'd have in the future). The sabots would be designed to fall away from the 
pellets, allowing them to spread out and cover more of an area. In effect it 
would be a shotgun, only using magnetic forces to propel the shot instead of 
explosives.
      Not that I have any problems with normal guns. I just think that they 
might be replace by more advanced weapons about a hundred years from now. After 
all, the U.S. did recently test a huge railgun that was mounted on a Navy 
battle ship. Anyway, onto the next group of weapons...
 
      [2] Plasma Weapons
 
Plasma, the fourth state of matter, is basically really, really hot gas. I 
think that the current theory states that the sun is made of hot plasma. That 
being said, one can imagine the destructive power of plasma as a weapon.
      I know that plasma can be generated in modern laboratories, though it 
cools extremely fast in the cold atmospheres of Earth. That being said, a 
plasma weapon would probably work best as a flame-thrower type gun, a ranged 
projectile weapon, or a grenade. Because plasma is so hot, it would burn through 
just about anything it touches, and ignite anything it doesn't incinerate, making 
it extremely effective against most targets (though a heat resistant 
force-field could block it).
      Plasma guns would require some kind of material (probably hydrogen 
since it's so light, but maybe helium because it's more stable) as fuel and a 
power source to heat the plasma (like the battery inside of a railgun). There 
would also have to be some kind of containment field that keeps the plasma from 
melting the gun.
      Due to the powerful nature of these weapons they should probably not be 
found until at least the middle of the game (though if the enemies get 
really, really strong before then than plasma guns would actually balance things out 
more).
 
     [3] Ion Weapons
 
Modern ion weapons use weak laser pulses to create an ion "current" in the 
air (HSV Technologies have been developing one for quite a while now: 
"http://www.hsvt.org/ ). The gun then sends electricity along the current, shocking the 
target.
      Ion weapons can be used to stun or kill. They would be effective 
against most organic and inorganic targets. Their biggest weakness is that one need 
only have a suit of electric-insulating materials (such as rubber) to protect 
himself from the weapon's power.
      An ion gun could conceivably be set to ionise a wide section of air, 
meaning that it could work much like the minigun in Xenocide, using the "burst" 
fire setting. They would probably be most effective against organic targets, 
or non-insulated robots.
 
     [4] EMP Weapons
 
EMP is an acronym that stands for Electro Magnetic Pulse. An EMP weapon (such 
as a grenade or cannon) would most likely be used to destroy robots and 
computers, though a strong magnetic field could damage organic life forms [that's 
just a guess, BTW :)].
      Now, if an enemy is wearing metal armour, I suppose you could use a 
magnetic pulse to send him flying... Kind of like 'Magneto' from the X-Men.
 
      Well, that's about all I have to say about these futuristic weapons. 
Like I said, if anyone has any corrections to make, or anything to add, feel 
free. I won't complain :)
 
God Bless,

   -Steve

It would make more sense that if someone went to med school that he's have an 
easier time learning how to heal himself more efficiently than someone who's 
education was comprised mostly of firearms and combat training. Though I think 
that in time anyone could reach a higher skill level, given enough training 
and practice.

That sounds like an interesting idea, though, like all dangerous items, it 
shouldn't be found too early in the game (IMHO). What about a "Nano Virus 
Capsule" that fills the player with harmful nanites that proceed to slowly tear him 
apart? Or maybe a 'mutation' pill (similar to the potions of mutation in 
crawl) that cause the player to sprout random additions, some harmful, some helpful?
 
Speaking of mutations, Jakub, are you planning on adding a mutation system? I 
know that there's going to be a radio-active desert...

It's alright, no need to be sorry. I was kind of trying to keep things simple 
in regards to explaining the rules of English (because the rules are already 
so complex)...
 
But you are right. Things like "rubbish", "water" and "air" can't be counted 
without using some kind of measuring system for reference (you can say "I have 
a litre of water" but not "I have a water", you can even say "I have some 
water" or "I have no water"), because they refer to a collective mass and not a 
single object.
 
Anyway...
 
I have some additional thoughts on weapons, but I'll send those out as a 
separate message, because they take up a lot of space.
 
God Bless,
 
   -Steve

>Hello, list!
>(My, this is turning into a crowd - am I the third member or what?)
 
Welcome to the list! Yes, it was only Jakub and me for a while. Now that 
there are more than just two people, the list actually serves a purpose.
 
Anyway, I like the ideas [if that matters to any one :)]. The implants are 
interesting, though it might be a good idea if some of them have to be recharged 
(or maybe recharge themselves from the player's body heat and/or electrical 
energy) after a while.
 
Also, what about a sub-dermal cloaking device? And a sonic imaging device, 
that would let the player track enemies by sound (similar to a sonar radar)? And 
maybe a built in force-field type of device that protects the player against 
different kinds of energies (like elecrictal attacks or the heat from a 
grenade)?

Well, that's all I have to say. For now, at least. God Bless,

   -Steve

Hello again, list!

I wanted to express my own views on some of the things that have been
discussed on the list so far. Since most of them are somewhat old already,
I'll try to compress it all into one message (and get it done before Jakub,
who seems to be on a roll, can make all the changes that make these comments
obsolete). Hang on.

[Re: weakness of armour]
So far, I haven't found repairing damaged armour annoying at all. It may
be that I've been lucky and there has always been a new suit of armour just
around the corner before the old one fell to pieces, but it has worked just
fine for me. However, if armour degradation is to be changed, I'd say it
would be better to base it still on the amount of damage, and not on the
type of enemy or attack. We don't want to force the player to lug around
a suit of acid-resistant armour on the off chance that an acidic monster
might happen by (or because he knows, based on an earlier savegame, that
one will be waiting around the corner!).

A simple solution that could work would be to base armour degradation on
the attack damage multiplied by itself. For example: if armour loses, say,
one HP per 100 points of adjusted damage, an attack doing 10 points of
damage would cause 1 HP of damage to armour (any weaker - such as being
punched with a fist - and the armour won't be affected at all), but an
attack doing 20 points of damage would now damage armour for 4 HP. Thus,
the enemies to watch out for are those who do massive damage - not those
who can specifically strip you of your armour.

Or maybe rate armour types for "hardness", and attack types for what levels
of hardness they can damage (with some random deviation thrown in to keep
the player guessing). It then becomes a question of whether to choose the
harder (and bulkier, and heavier) armour or the lighter armour that's bound
to get ripped to shreds - and not one of only standing a chance against
specific enemies if you have had the good fortune of finding the right gear
against them.

Game balance is all about trade-offs.

[Re: skill system]
Personally, I'd hate to see Xenocide have to rely on some mechanistic hack
such as having a window pop up every level advance and happily announce
"now you get to distribute all those hard-earned points!" However, I think
this whole question of changing the skill system arose from the fact that
the player's accuracy with a gun at the beginning of the game leaves some-
thing to be desired, forcing him to waste ammunition while learning to
shoot. Well, this problem won't go away by introducing a system whereby
your skills just magically leap up every time a certain number of nasties
have been killed - it would just mean that even trying to use that gun
before such time was utterly useless, as it has no effect on increasing
your skill (you'd be better off learning to shoot by whacking them over
the head with a spanner). To solve the accuracy problem, the creatures in
the early stages of the game will have to be made easier - or the char-
acter's starting skills higher.

Now, if the actual mechanics of skill advancement were to be changed, I
have two suggestions. If a level-based addition was desired, every character
class could be given a list of skills that will increase automatically at
every level-up - in addition to the "learning by doing" advancement. On
the other hand, the "hands-on experience" mechanics could be very simply
enhanced by giving each class an "experience multiplier" for certain skills
so that a medic gets more out of healing than does a combat spec (the
multiplier could even degrade over time, to assure the other classes can
catch up). Maybe the system already works like this, I don't know.

[Re: the Suicide Pill:]
I agree wholeheartedly with Jakub - nasty tricks like this add little to
entertainment value. Of course, from a historical viewpoint, many Rogue-
likes, most notably Nethack, seem to thrive on them. I have a friend who
has had more than one Nethack character killed by "a trickery" - apparently
a completely random event that kills a character outright (and supposedly
one of the rarest ways to die, something like one in 2400). But, as it was
put in more than one gamemaster guide, anything short of killing the
character outright is fine. How about a toxin pill that reduces your HP
to one? ^_^

[Re: message buffer:]
It should definitely be saved, at least the couple dozen most recent
entries, for exactly the reasons that Stephen mentioned. For us weekend
players it can be several days since our last game, and any memory help
as to just what I was doing when I left last time is invaluable.

And just to nit-pick:

> I noticed that when ever I find organic rubbish the game says "There is an
> organic rubbish here". But in the English language, the word 'rubbish' is
> considered plural, so it should read 'some organic rubbish' or 'a pile of >
Ah, but 'rubbish' is NOT a plural noun - it is what is called a "mass" or
"uncountable" noun. THAT's why you say things like "There is some rubbish"
and not "There are a few rubbish here."

Well, this is getting off to a fine start. Lecturing a native speaker about
language details. O_o Sorry about that.

I'll get back to the story and "ideas.txt" when I have more time. Till
then...

Hello, list!
(My, this is turning into a crowd - am I the third member or what?)

Jakub asked me to share these ideas I had for the beginning of a list of
bionic implants. Come to think of it, an inventory even this long would
serve a game like Xenocide very well, where the implants are for flavour
and not the main course. Anyway, on with the list.

- A targetter eye to aid with shooting.
- An infra-red eye sensor to spot (warm-blooded) creatures from a long way
 off.
- A built-in filter to protect against all harmful gasses.
- Hydraulic legs to allow for greater movement speed (and, possibly, a
 powerful unarmed attack).
- Motorised arms for greater strength in melee combat at least, possibly
 for lifting/carrying purposes as well (realistically, this would require
 reinforcing the entire skeleton so that the arm is not ripped right out
 of its socket, but such a series of prerequisites may be too bothersome
 to implement).
- Built-in weapons, like a shoulder gun, or Wolverine's (of "the X-Men" fame)
 claws.
- Remedies for all the specific "character conditions": antidote injectors
 against poisoning and/or sickness, polarising eye filters against blinding,
 endorphine boosters against stunning, etc.
- Automatic injectors for any and all drugs: nanites for massive injury,
 antidotes as above, and so on. If you're generous, they could come with an
 unlimited supply. If you're mean, they could require constant reloading
 with the drug in question (which would cause trouble if the antidote in-
 jector gave a shot every time you took a hit from a poisonous creature..).
- Subdermal armour (ballistic weave right underneath the skin) for added
 protection.

Many more can be devised, and probably will be. For the record, I'd much
rather see a limited list of well-thought-out items than an inventory as
long as your arm with no purpose other than for a respectable number on
the feature list: "N+1 bionic implants!"

Anyway. More to come. Take care.

Greetings to all!

Yeah, it does work now.

Yes, full screen mode does run fast enough.
 
Anyway, Jakub, Xenocide is still fun to play, and it's starting to feel more 
and more like a traditional roguelike. Just a few thoughts, though.
 
I like the message buffer. It would probably be nice to give the player the 
option of saving it, so he can remember what he did the last time he was 
playing.
 
Also, I started playing the game as a mechanic. I wonder, shouldn't mechanics 
start with a wrench instead of a knife? Or maybe some kind of power tool...
 
I noticed that when ever I find organic rubbish the game says "There is an 
organic rubbish here". But in the English language, the word 'rubbish' is 
considered plural, so it should read 'some organic rubbish' or 'a pile of organic 
rubbish'. I'll keep an eye out for anymore English errors I see, and try to help 
you to correct them.
 
On the matter of skills, I've always liked the skill system in ADOM, though I 
am more partial to a skill system that improves a the player does things 
(e.g. the player shooting his pistol would train his pistol skills). But those are 
just my thoughts.
 
Also, I've cleaned up the revised story you sent me...
 
***
 
The year is 2129, and man has taken to the stars. With him he had brought
all of the wonders and horrors that he was wrought throughout the ages;
joy and sorrow, peace and war, life and death.
He has also found that he is not alone...
 
In 2058 a huge leap forward was made in the world of interplanetary
expedition. An international group of brilliant scientists,
along with large grants from various nations and private organizations,
developed a prototype hyper-drive engine, a device capable of accelerating
matter so that it would be able to move at speeds faster than even light
could travel.
 
In 2076 a stable hyper-drive unit was developed, and the device
was successfully tested. Gone were the days of conventional space travel,
taking months to get from one planet to another; now a ship took only
a few days to travel between stars.
 
So man began to expand his empire. Various nations utilized the hyper-drive
engines to begin colonizing other planets. They started with Mars, and then
the moons of Jupiter.
 
Flash forward to the year 2099 Vast interstellar corporations have been
developed, their purpose to explore and colonize far off worlds.
Most of the planets they have found cannot support human life,
and so enormous Biospheres have been build; domes containing oxygen and water,
made to replicate the ecosystem of Earth. There were other planets that man
could live on without artificial aid, but these were few and far between.
 
The year was 2121. As we made our way from one end of the Milky Way
to the other we had discovered various alien life forms;
everything from harmless plant-life to bizarre beasts and fantastic creatures
that even the wildest of imaginations could not have conceived outside
of a dream. For all of the organisms that man had encountered, however,
he had yet to run across anything that was even remotely intelligent.
That was about to change.
 
On Earth date 19-11-2121 AD, at approximately 20:45 GMT, the deep space
exploration vessel Columbus encountered a strange metallic object,
roughly the size of a mega-freighter, orbiting a large asteroid.
Upon closer inspection the asteroid appeared to be colonized,
and the object appeared to be a ship of some sort, though one unlike
any that man had ever seen. The human race had had its first glimpse
of an intelligent alien civilization.
 
The crew of the Columbus attempted to make contact with the alien vessel,
but they received no response. They waited for ten long hours,
transmitting the same message of greetings and peace.
Then, just when most of the crew had begun to suspect that the alien
vessel might be abandoned, they received a response from it.
The response did not come in the form of a communication, it came in the form
of a missile, a missile with an antimatter warhead.
 
Needless to say, the Columbus was obliterated. No one survived the attack.
The entire crew, people who had once been fathers and mothers, brothers
and sisters, sons and daughters; were nothing more than dust, floating amidst
celestial blackness.
 
Thus began the war. On one side the humans, a race of beings who had believed
themselves to be the invincible masters of the cosmos. They were now realising
the extend of their own mortality.
 
On the other side of the war were the aliens, beings known only as the 
'Enemy'.
Other than the fact that they were hostile and that their weapons were
far more advanced than the humans, little was known about them. The forces
of Earth had no idea what kind of organisms they were up against,
though several reports from the front lines seemed to indicated that
the creatures may have been insectoid in appearance.
 
The war raged on for seven long years, the forces of the Enemy slowly making
their way toward Earth. The alien creatures seemed to serve no other purpose
than to spread chaos and death. They were evil, evil to the core, and they
had to be eliminated.
 
The year is 2129, and the war has come to a standstill. The Enemy can not
advance any further, but it refuses to retreat. You were a worker
on the mega-freighter Atlas, a cargo ship owned by the GenTech Company whose
purpose was to transport raw ore from mining colonies to manufacturing
facilities where the ore would be processed and refined.
 
The next stop for the Atlas was the planet Tartarus 3, a small world
that existed far away from the lines of battle. This planet could support
human life, and a mining colony had been built to harvest the valuable
minerals that lay deep beneath the surface. It was the next unnamed colony,
where refuges usually find place to live.
 
You had heard that the miners told strange stories about creatures that lived
beneath the mines. Supposedly there were hideous monsters that dwelt
beneath the surface, and whenever a miner or other colony worker went missing
his disappearance was blamed on these beasts. Some even said that strange
genetic experiments were being performed in a secret base beneath the colony.
You didn't really believe any of those stories, though. After all,
genetic manipulation was illegal.
 
As the Atlas approached Tartarus 3, the onboard view screens began to show
that the planet's surface was strangely inactive. The colony should have been
as busy as an anthill, with miners running about to make preparations for the
arrival of the shuttle, but everything seemed to be so quiet, so still, so...
 
...dead. Everything seemed so dead.
 
The Atlas' captain tried to hail the colony. No one was surprised by the lack
of a response. Something was seriously wrong, and everyone knew it. As the
captain was about to order the ship's retreat, disaster struck. At that very
moment a volley of missiles leapt up from the planet's surface and struck the
ship head on.
 
The force of the ensuing explosions knocked you from your feet. As you fell,
you hit your head, and passed into unconsciousness.
 
When you awoke, you were unharmed, aside from a splitting head ache.
All around you the floor, ceiling and walls were stained with the red blood
and the tattered bodies of dead men. This wasn't caused by the missiles;
someone - or something - had torn your fellow crewmen apart.
 
Then you heard it; a sound, like the sound of some small creature scurrying
about. You are not alone; something is lurking about the ship, and whatever
it is, you get the feeling that it's responsible for the deaths of the crew.
You don't care what horrors lie on the planet below, anything is better than
this. You have to make it to the escape pods on the bottom level of the ship,
and get the hell out of here. You can worry about the Enemy forces later;
your only goal right now is to escape and survive. Survive...
 
***
 
I hope that's satisfactory. Also, I took the liberty of cleaning up the 
"about the game" section of the manual file...
 
***
 
"Xenocide the roguelike" is a single-player game that uses ASCII (text) 
graphics. It looks similar in appearance to ADOM, NetHack or Crawl, the main 
difference being the world in which the game is set. In Xenocide you won't find 
goblins, magic or knights - the action takes place
in the future.
 
***
 
Anyway, I hope you like it.
 
Plus, I wrote descriptions for some more monsters...
 
Crazy Scientist: "This man was once a brilliant scientist, but now he is a 
mindless shell of his former self, driven to madness by the horrors he has 
witnessed. He shambles along, mumbling and muttering under his breath, and sometime 
cackling with delight at sights only he can see. As you watch him hopping 
about you get the feeling that he is dangerous, and should be avoided."
 
Crazy Technician (Technician was spelled wrong, BTW. This is the correct 
spelling): "Fear filled, wild eyes glisten from out the darkness, belonging to a 
man that has lost all capacity for rational thought. The terrors he has seen 
have shattered his mind, causing him to abandon his work in favour of a new job; 
killing everyone and everything that moves, because they all pose a threat to 
him in his mind. He sees you as a threat as well, and will not hesitate to 
butcher your body."
 
Crazy Miner: "The job of a miner is a dangerous thing, especially in the 
mines of Tartarus 3, where all manner of strange creatures run wild. Most people 
couldn't handle the stress of working under such conditions, and many of them 
would snap under the pressure. This is true of the man you are looking at. The 
nightmares that he had witnessed drove him over the brink of insanity. His 
eyes are cold and lifeless, yet he still lives, and he seeks the ruin of all 
around him, including you."
 
Bunker Gun: "The bunker gun is a much larger version of the standard sentry 
rifle. It is outfitted with an enormous cannon, that revolves around on a base 
turret. You can clearly see that this gun is designed to kill, and that there 
are few persons, if any, that could survive an attack by such a weapon."
 
Searchlight: "An immense searchlight, like the kind often used by the 
military in days long since passed. This particular model is extremely large and 
bright, and is designed to aide the bunker guns in spotting and eliminating all 
possible intruders."
 
Anyway, that's all for now.
 
BTW, I read through your 'ideas' file. I really like most of them, especially 
the monsters that split into smaller ones and the ones that explode when 
killed. Also, if the player were to combine his DNA with a corpse-eating monster, 
could he then eat the corpses of fallen monsters to regain health? Just a 
thought :)
 
And on the matter of adding sonic weapons; I remember reading an article in a 
science magazine over here about a sound-wave that scientists had developed 
in a laboratory. This sound wave was inaudible until it reverberated off of a 
solid object. The idea was that this could be used as a non-lethal sort of 
weapon, firing super loud sound waves at a criminal and knocking him out. Since 
the waves can't be heard until they hit a solid object, the man firing the sound 
weapons would most likely be unharmed (though he would probably be wearing 
ear protection, just in case), but the criminal would be knocked out.
 
Of course, sound would most likely stun (and deafen? will sound play a role 
in Xenocide?), and sound waves would explode out in a radius, much like a 
grenade.
 
Gravity and anti-gravity weapons would be nice. What about plasma, ion and 
rail-gun weapons?
 
Anyway, I have to get going now. God bless,
 
   -Steve

Well, the archive was broken. I've uploaded the new one and tried it
- it should be fine now.

DOS version is very slow, when played in Window mode. Turn to
FullScreen to make it fast (ALT+Enter).
Windows version works slow on CPU slower than 600MHz, because of
Curses library. On 600+ works faster than DOS version.

It would be too deadly :) I'll add some nasty pills instead :)

Bunker gun - now it's based on Sentry Gun, but it will be changed.
It's a gun that protects enterance to the Enemy bunker.
Deadly. Maybe some kind of laser weapon that player can avoid by
invisibility or by a special armour...

Searchlight is a searchlight :)

Jakub

Sorry it took me so long to reply. I've been rather busy for the past few 
days.
 
>New test version of Xenocide is available:
>http://www.roguelikedevelopment.org/graveyard/files/xeno_test.zip
 
     I downloaded this new version but for some reason I can't extract it. 
WinZip keeps telling me it's not a valid archive (I didn't have a problem 
unzipping any previous versions of Xenocide...) So I'm going to give feedback on the 
previous test version of Xenocide, until I can extract the new one...
 
     Anyway, I've played more of the test version, and I have found a few 
bugs. For one, the DOS version has been moving kind of slow (though not as slow 
as the Windows version). Also, sometimes I've seen the targeting cursor 
disappear when I'm aiming at an enemy.
     Other than that I haven't seen any bugs that I can think of right now.
 
     Also, now that they're unidentified pills, Xenocide is beginning to feel 
a lot more like a roguelike. It's really coming along well. I wonder, will 
there be a 'suicide pill' that would kill the player after he ingests it? I 
think you should implement it :)
     Anyway, I can't write more right now. I'll keep trying to extract the 
new test version of Xenocide, but I get the feeling the problem might not be my 
computer...
 
God Bless,
 
     -Steve

Hi

New test version of Xenocide is available:
http://www.roguelikedevelopment.org/graveyard/files/xeno_test.zip

Main changes since last version:
- removed BLK attribute from Armours, replaced with stat modifiers.
- mines filled with monsters (not completed)
- message buffer
- less ammo types on shuttle (were too many and was hard to find useful)
- The begin of manual is written (with modified a bit story - Stephen,
please, read it and correct mistakes, if any)

Do you think that message buffer should be saved?

Do you like the idea of changing skill system into similar to the one
from Fallout, where on level advance player can choose skills to
improve?

regards,
Jakub

Thanks again for testing. Have you found any bugs?
Today, after a long break (because of work), I'm going to rewrite the
skill system to the one described before.

For now shooting accuracy depends on skill, but when an enemy is near,
player has almost 100% chance to hit the enemy (depending on dodging
skill). Well... I won't forbid to use weapon with lesser skill than
required, but some random events will happen (like mentioned by you)

Hm... I'm against the too much of realism in my game. The game should
be fun, and progress of character just by playing is usually fun and
is predictable. Items are random - it could happen, that player that
had bad luck will die without items necessary to incrase his skills.

Well, Bunker Enterance is a BIT too hard :) For now there are a few
sentry guns that do triple shoot with 100% accuracy. I'll decrase
their power a bit, but direct attack at the bunker should be deadly.
Player of course can avoid searchlights too...

No, there won't be body parts. All the roguelike developers had bad
experiences with it. I'm against such realism too.

Great :) I really like it :)

Jakub,

    I played the test version of Xenocide. It's more balanced, though I think 
it's still too easy to die in the early levels. I'll have more feed back 
after I've played it some more.
 
>1. Weakness of armor (it's annoying to take care about it so much)
 
    Yeah, it is a pain. But I like the idea of making it only take heavy 
damage from strong attacks.

    I like the idea for having stat requirements for using different weapons, 
but not so much for skill requirements. I mean, if a player has no skill 
using Small Guns, then he could still try and use a weapon, only he might not get 
it to fire, or he might end up blowing his own hands off. The same thing with 
strength. Maybe he can use it, but he's too weak to lift it, so his shots just 
hit the floor.
 
    Also, I think that the player should be able to select his own skills 
when he starts the game, and have him keep those skills for the most part. I 
think it should be very hard to advance skills, to make the game more realistic. 
But maybe the player could find a device that lets him upload knowledge into 
his brain, thus increasing his skill level.

    I'd say it's better to leave the enemies with guns until later in the 
game, where the player should already have enough armour to keep him from getting 
killed instantly. I already had a run in with the Bunker Gun. It killed me in 
two shots, but I didn't have any armour on.
 
    Also, I like the idea of having different armour parts for different body 
parts. Of course you would have to program the different body parts as well. 
Maybe Upper Torso, Lower Torso, Head, Right Leg, Left Leg, Right Foot, Left 
Foot, Right Arm, Left Arm, Right Hand, Left Hand? Of course the torso would be 
the easiest for the enemy to hit, followed by the limbs and head.
 
    BTW, I've incorporated the new ideas you sent me into the story. Here we 
have the Xenocide Story, version 0.1.5 (beta):

---
 
The year is 2189, and man has taken to the stars. With him he had brought all 
of the wonders and horrors that he was wrought throughout the ages; joy and 
sorrow, peace and war, life and death. He has also found that he is not alone...
     In 2058 a huge leap forward was made in the world of interplanetary 
expedition. An international group of brilliant scientists, along with large 
grants from various nations and private organizations, developed a prototype 
hyper-drive engine, a device capable of accelerating matter so that it would be able 
to move at speeds faster than even light could travel.
     In 2076 a stable hyper-drive unit was developed, and the device was 
successfully tested. Gone were the days of conventional space travel, taking 
months to get from one planet to another; now a ship took only a few days to travel 
between stars.
     So man began to expand his empire. Various nations utilized the 
hyper-drive engines to begin colonizing other planets. They started with Mars, and 
then the moons of Jupiter.
Flash forward to the year 2155. Vast interstellar corporations have been 
developed, their purpose to explore and colonize far off worlds. Most of the 
planets they have found cannot support human life, and so enormous Biospheres have 
been build; domes containing oxygen and water, made to replicate the ecosystem 
of Earth. There were other planets that man could live on without artificial 
aid, but these were few and far between.
The year was 2181. As we made our way from one end of the Milky Way to the 
other we had discovered various alien life forms; everything from harmless 
plant-life to bizarre beasts and fantastic creatures that even the wildest of 
imaginations could not have conceived outside of a dream. For all of the organisms 
that man had encountered, however, he had yet to run across anything that was 
even remotely intelligent. That was about to change.
On Earth date 19-11-2181 AD, at approximately 20:45 GMT, the deep space 
exploration vessel Columbus encountered a strange metallic object, roughly the size 
of a mega-freighter, orbiting a large asteroid. Upon closer inspection the 
asteroid appeared to be colonized, and the object appeared to be a ship of some 
sort, though one unlike any that man had ever seen. The human race had had its 
first glimpse of an intelligent alien civilization.
The crew of the Columbus attempted to make contact with the alien vessel, but 
they received no response. They waited for ten long hours, transmitting the 
same message of greetings and peace. Then, just when most of the crew had begun 
to suspect that the alien vessel might be abandoned, they received a response 
from it. The response did not come in the form of a communication, it came in 
the form of a missile, a missile with an antimatter warhead.
Needless to say, the Columbus was obliterated. No one survived the attack. 
The entire crew, people who had once been fathers and mothers, brothers and 
sisters, sons and daughters; were nothing more than dust, floating amidst 
celestial blackness.
Thus began the war. On one side the humans, a race of beings who had believed 
themselves to be the invincible masters of the cosmos. They were now 
realising the extend of their own mortality.
On the other side of the war were the aliens, beings known only as the 
'Enemy'. Other than the fact that they were hostile and that their weapons were for 
more advanced than the humans, little was known about them. The forces of 
Earth had no idea what kind of organisms they were up against, though several 
reports from the front lines seemed to indicated that the creatures may have been 
insectoid in appearance. (NOTE: I put insectoid, but if you want them to be 
reptilian or avian or cthulhuian or whatever just say the word.)
The war raged on for seven long years, the forces of the Enemy slowly making 
their way toward Earth. The alien creatures seemed to serve no other purpose 
than to spread chaos and death. They were evil, evil to the core, and they had 
to be eliminated.
The year is 2189, and the war had come to a standstill. The Enemy can not 
advance any further, but it refuses to retreat. You were a worker on the 
mega-freighter Atlas, a cargo ship owned by the GenTech Company whose purpose was to 
transport raw ore from mining colonies to manufacturing facilities where the 
ore would be processed and refined.
     The next stop for the Atlas was the planet Tartarus 3, a small world 
that existed far away from the lines of battle. This planet could support human 
life, and so a domeless mining colony had been built to harvest the valuable 
minerals that lay deep beneath the surface.
     You had heard that the miners told strange stories about creatures that 
lived beneath the mines. Supposedly there were hideous monsters that dwelt 
beneath the surface, and whenever a miner or other colony worker went missing his 
disappearance was blamed on these beasts. Some even said that strange genetic 
experiments were being performed in a secret base beneath the colony. You 
didn't really believe any of those stories, though. After all, genetic 
manipulation was illegal.
     As the Atlas approached Tartarus 3, the onboard view screens began to 
show a strange red light emanating from the city that rested above the colonial 
mines. As the ship drew nearer to the planet, the origin of the lights became 
clear; it was fire, the colony was on fire.
     The crew of the Atlas watched in horror as they saw the flames begin to 
devour the buildings the colony. Bombs exploded all across the surface, 
blasting apart people and buildings. This didn't look like the work of some small 
raiding party; this was a heavy military assault, which could only mean one 
thing: The Enemy had arrived.
     The Atlas' captain didn't know how the Enemy forces were able to get so 
far behind the front line, but he didn't think about it then. His only 
priority was to get his ship and crew as far away from the Enemy as possible. The 
Atlas was a cargo ship, not a fighter, and she wasn't equipped to defend herself.
     Just as the captain was about to give the order to retreat, disaster 
struck. The Enemy forces on the surface must have sighted the Atlas, because at 
that very moment a volley of missiles leapt up from the planet's surface and 
struck the ship head on.
     The force of the ensuing explosions knocked you from your feet. As you 
fell you hit your head, and passed into unconsciousness.
     When you awoke, you were unharmed, aside from a splitting head ache. All 
around you the floor, ceiling and walls were stained with the red blood and 
the tattered bodies of dead men. This wasn't caused by the missiles; someone - 
or something - had torn your fellow crewmen apart.
     Then you heard it; a sound, like the sound of some small creature 
scurrying about. You are not alone; something is lurking about the ship, and 
whatever it is, you get the feeling that it's responsible for the deaths of the crew. 
You don't care what horrors lie on the planet below, anything is better than 
this. You have to make it to the escape pods on the bottom level of the ship, 
and get the hell out of here. You can worry about the Enemy forces later; your 
only goal right now is to escape and survive. Survive...

---
 
    Anyway, that's about it. The story still needs work, but it's getting 
there. The monster descriptions are on the way, too. Keep up the good work, Jakub.
 
God Bless,
 
     -Steve

Hi!

As I said - new test version is available:
http://www.roguelikedevelopment.org/graveyard/files/xeno_test.zip
There are a lot of changes in this version. Most of them described in
changes.txt. For testing purposes on the first level of shuttle there
is a teleport to new location, that is available (for now) from first
level of mines. It teleports you to the same location where teleport
is, so when teleport is too high on the map, you'll be teleported near
guns and you'll died in one turn. Stairs to the mines are generated on
the random place, what will be changed to the bottom of the map.
I've also translated free ideas that probably will be implemented
soon. They are in ideas.txt file.

I have some problems now:
1. Weakness of armor (it's annoying to take care about it so much)
2. Repairing robots is annoying
3. Skill system and range weapons

For first two points I think I have solution - an answer from
rec.games.roguelike.development group (my sentences are qouted, answer
is unqouted):
---------- < cut here > --------------------
> Because player has to care about his armour, repair it or carry a
lot of
> armours
> in his backpack. It's annoying and don't improve gameplay in any
way.

I think it works well if it's designed right. I agree that the items
should not degrade quickly. I want to keep item damage and breakage
for
special situations.

I.e. common fights will not damage swords. But if you encounter a
stone
golem, and hit it with a blade weapon, the blade will be damaged.
Stone
golems will be rare, so this is an exceptional encounter with
exceptional effects.

Same for armor. The usual every day battle will do only a little harm,
and armor will last long (maybe even a complete game). But some
attacks
will damge it seriously, i.e. a wooden shield will not sustain a lot
of
fire breath attacks. OTOH if wooden shields are common, there
shouldn't
be a lot of fire-breathers around, otherwise it gets annoying for the
palyer.

IMO it's a question of balance. Items should not degarde too fast or
break often. This should be kept for special encounters and unusual
situations.

Used this way, it can be a surpirse and challenge for the player.

> The same problem I have with robots - they do not self reconstruct

It depends how hard it is to replace them. If the playr can get new
ones
easily it doesn't matter if they are destroyed often. In that case
they
are simialr to arrows or bolts in traditional roguelieks that must be
restocked frequently because the are lost or broken so quickly.

If it's hard to get new robots, they should last long IMO.

A "repair all" command can help, too. As long as you have spare parts,
it's only one keypress to repair your army.
---
> Hm... You're right. It could work...
> Only armor percing attacks (and fire) will damage armor...

And you could make `take care of your equipment while resting'
option, that would regenerate your possesions slightly.

---------- < cut here > --------------------

So, I will do what is written - proposed solutions are good.

The problem is with skill system. It works quite well, but only for
hand to hand combat. Player almost can't improve his other skills,
because of limited ammo or items... I think that I'll have to change
experience system to similar to ADOM or Fallout - after level advance
player will choose skills to improve. What is the reason to do that?
Well... The main problem lays in characted advance... For now he can
use all the items he find - weapons and tools. I plan to do some
restrictions f.e. player need Small Guns skill on 7 to use a weapon,
and Strength at least 13. Such things are necessary for gameplay.

Next problem I have is with difficulty level - how to prevent instant
deaths when enemy has an automatic gun? Burst and you're dead... Such
situations can happen often... For now - armors have to attributes -
ARM and BLK. ARM describes how much damage will stop on armor, and BLK
describes percentage changce to stop an attack. Unfortunatelly it can
happen, that armor won't block any bullet and player will take all
with full power :/ Maybe solution is to add more parts of armor? Like
boots, pants, helmet etc.?

Unfortunatelly I'm in hurry now and can't write anything longer.
Please, test the version and write some comments. I'll be back in the
middle of next week.

Regards,
Jakub
