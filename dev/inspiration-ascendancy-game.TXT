-------------------------------------
PLANTARY ITEMS

Factory
     The Factory is a common structure on most colonized
     planets.  Factories
     increase a colony's industry, which helps speed the
     completion of
     planetary projects.

Agriplot
     The Agriplot is a high-productivity farming area.
     Agriplots increase a
     colony's prosperity, which causes its population to
     grow more quickly.

Laboratory
     The Laboratory is a center for research and
     development.  Laboratories
     provide research, which allows a species to make
     technological discoveries.

Habitat
     The Habitat is a high-density living and working
     complex with a precisely
     controlled internal climate.  Habitats provide a colony
     with prosperity,
     and also allow room for additional population.

Metroplex
     The Metroplex is an urban center with industrial,
     technological, and
     residential capacities.

Colony Base
     You should not be able to build this.

Industrial Megafacility
     The Industrial Megafacility is a huge, self-reliant
     production plant.
     Its industrial output is greater than that of a
     Factory.

Artificial Hydroponifer
     The Artificial Hydroponifer is a super-efficient
     nourishment production
     facility.  Its prosperity output is greater than that

     of an Agriplot.

Research Campus
     The Research Campus is a well-equipped experimentation
     center.  It is of more
     research value than a Laboratory.

Logic Factory
     The Logic Factory is a research complex that
     specializes in the
     entertainment and happiness of sentient beings.  It
     provides both research
     and prosperity.

Engineering Retreat
     The Engineering Retreat is an academized production
     plant where engineers
     devise improvements in logistics and production
     methods.  It provides a colony
     with industry as well as research.

Surface Cloaker
     The Surface Cloaker uses high-frequency diffraction
     generators to make a
     planet surface practically invisible to alien ships.

Hyperpower Plant
     The Hyperpower Plant is a marvel of high technology.
     By generating power
     for all of a colony's industry structures, it
     significantly increases the
     colony's entire industrial output.  There is no need
     for more than one
     Hyperpower Plant on any colony.

Fertilization Plant
     The Fertilization Plant produces vast quantities of
     agricultural and
     hydroponics supplies.  It boosts the prosperity of an
     entire colony.  There
     is no need for more than one Fertilization Plant on any
     colony.

Internet
     The Internet provides a colony with a high-speed
     information and data
     transfer system.  It greatly improves the progress made
     by a colony's
     research centers.  There is no need to build more than
     one Internet on any
     colony.

Cloning Plant
     The Cloning Plant organically duplicates new members of
     a planet's
     population.  There is no need to build more than one
     Cloning Plant on any
     planet.

Observation Installation
     The Observation Installation scans nearby alien ships.
     There is no need to build more than one Observation
     Installation on any
     planet.

Tractor Beam Element
     The Tractor Beam generates a powerful stasis field to
     overcome a ship's drives
     and pull it toward a planet.  You can use a planet's
     Tractor Beam in the System
     Display by selecting the planet and then selecting the
     Tractor Beam from its
     item list.

Surface Shield
     The Surface Shield houses defense armaments that
     protect a colony against
     alien invasion.  Several Surface Shields may be
     necessary to defend against
     large invasion forces.

Surface Mega Shield
     The Surface Mega Shield is a powerful defense against
     alien invasion. It
     uses protective ion fields to augment the endurance of
     its defense armaments.  It is much more valuable than
     the normal Surface
     Shield, but certainly not invulnerable.

Outpost
     The Outpost is an important structure for colonies on
     small or minimally
     habitable planets.  It provides living facilities for
     additional
     population.

Transport Tubes
     Transport Tubes allow colony structures to spread
     quickly over the surface
     of a planet.  They are easy to produce, require no
     maintenance, and can even
     be constructed on black squares.

Shipyard
     The Shipyard is an enormous orbital center for the
     production of space ships.
     Though expensive to construct, it is a necessary first
     step toward space
     exploration.  A colony must have a Shipyard in order to
     build ships.

Ship
     Ships are the key to the exploration of space.  Each
     Ship can be designed
     differently, and can hold various types of equipment
     that allow it to do
     such things as travel, engage in combat, and colonize
     or invade planets.

Orbital Docks
     Orbital Docks provide a maintenance platform for the
     repair and refitting of
     ships.  Any ship orbiting a colony with Orbital Docks
     can be refitted.  When
     a ship is refitted, its contents may be changed, and
     its hull is repaired.
                                        
Orbital Cloaker
     The Orbital Cloaker uses modified diffraction
     generators to disguise structures
     orbiting a colony, rendering them invisible to alien
     ships.

Orbital Shields
     Orbital Shields are a colony's primary defense against
     alien invasion.  As
     long as a colony is protected by Orbital Shields, alien
     ships may not enter
     orbit.

Orbital Mega Shields
     Orbital Mega Shields are highly fortified planetary
     defenses.  Much harder to
     destroy than the lower-tech Orbital Shields, they
     prevent alien ships from
     entering orbit around a colony.

Orbital Missile Base
     The Orbital Missile Base is a potent short-range
     planetary weapon.  Though it
     may only be used once per game day, it can severely
     damage nearby ships.

Short Range Orbital Whopper
     The Short Range Orbital Whopper is a powerful planetary
     energy weapon with a
     short range.  It may be fired three times per day.  Woe
     to the ship that
     runs out of power while in its range.

Long Range Orbital Whopper
     The Long Range Orbital Whopper is the elite of
     planetary weaponry.  Its
     focused energy beams achieve a long range, and its
     reusability makes
     it dauntingly powerful.

Alien Hospitality
     Alien Hospitality is not an individual structure, but
     rather an overall
     planetary project.  While a colony dedicates its
     industry to Alien Hospitality,
     it helps improve diplomatic relations with alien
     species.

Interstellar Trucking
     Interstellar Trucking is a myth.

Endless Party
     The Endless Party is not an individual structure, but

     rather an overall
     planetary project.  While a colony's project is set to
     Endless Party,
     its prosperity increases by an amount proportional to
     its industrial output.

Scientist Takeover
     The Scientist Takeover is not an individual structure,
     but rather an overall
     planetary project.  While a colony's project is set to
     Scientist Takeover,
     its research progress increases by an amount
     proportional to its industrial output.

Automation
     Automation is a process by which the personnel
     maintaining a structure
     are replaced by robotic equipment. When a structure has
     been fully automated,
     its personnel are freed for use elsewhere on the
     colony.

Terraforming
     Terraforming is an important project for colonies on
     minimally habitable planets.
     When a black surface square is terraformed, it becomes
     a white square, and
     the colony may then build structures on it.

Lush Growth Bomb
     The Lush Growth Bomb combines chaos technology with
     organic synthesis
     equipment to make a planet surface significantly more
     habitable.  Only
     one Lush Growth Bomb is of noticeable value on any
     planet.

Xeno Archeological Dig
     The Xeno Archeological Dig allows a colony to uncover
     and analyze the ruinsof ancient civilizations.  When
     unearthed, these ruins very often providethe key to the
     discovery of advanced technologies.

GIZMOS

Mass Barrage Gun
     The %s launches a spray of projectiles from its
     electromagnetic
     accelerators.  It is cheap to build and uses little
     power_the projectiles
     are low-tech spheres of solid metal that rely on
     kinetic energy to do
     damage.  It is easy to deflect, slow to reload, and has
     a short range.

Fourier Missiles
     %s use image recognition to identify vulnerable areas
     of a ship.  They
     require little power to fire, but they reload slowly
     and don't do much damage.

Quantum Singularity Launcher
     The %s generates and fires tiny black holes_infinitely
     small but
     incredibly massive objects that easily punch through an
     Ion Wrap
     field.  The disadvantages of this weapon are its short
     range and long
     recharge time.

Molecular Disassociator
     The %s generates a cloud that weakens the molecular
     bonds in matter.
     This tends to corrode the target rapidly.  Its main
     drawback is that
     it takes a long time to form a fully charged cloud.

Electromagnetic Pulser
     The %s produces electromagnetic pulses that disrupt
     delicate technological
     equipment.  It does little structural damage but it
     strobes very quickly,
     producing many pulses in a short time that can overload
     and destroy
     the target ship.

Plasmatron
     The %s fires extremely long range bolts of super-heated
     plasma.  It
     takes a long time to recharge.

Ueberlaser
     The %s is a high-power pulse laser that cuts instantly
     through an
     unshielded ship hull.  It uses a lot of power but does
     heavy damage.

Fergnatz Lens
     The %s passively collects and focuses cosmic energies
     at its target.
     It requires no power to operate.

Hypersphere Driver
     The %s creates unstable bubbles in spacetime that
     extend into higher
     dimensions.  When these bubbles intersect normal matter
     they collapse,
     pinching off the matter inside another dimension.  They
     have a very long
     range and inflict massive damage.  This weapon is
     extremely expensive to
     produce and gobbles power.

Nanomanipulator
     The %s fires bursts of highly focused nanoenergon flux.
     The flux
     induces a chaotic nanowave upon impact that rips
     through the target,
     destructively jumbling alternate realities together.
     It is hugely
     destructive, fires in quick bursts, and uses a lot of
     power.

Ion Wrap
     The %s is a low-grade particle defense shield.  Like
     most shields,
     it only consumes power when it is active.

Concussion Shield
     The %s surrounds a ship with a flexible energy barrier
     that absorbs kinetic
     impulses and spreads them over its entire surface.
     Like most shields,
     it only consumes power when it is active.

Wave Scatterer
     The %s is an energy dispersion mechanism that passively
     diffracts and scatters
     energy waves as they make contact with a ship's hull.
     The Wave Scatterer is
     a weak defense, but unlike most shields it consumes no
     power.

Deactotron
     The %s is a high-tech active defense module.  When it
     detects the approach
     of particle or energy projectiles, it reacts by
     ejecting an appropriate
     countermeasure. Like most shields, it only consumes
     power when it is

Hyperwave Nullifier
     The %s surrounds a ship with a space-distorting
     hyperwave field.  The field
     causes incoming projectiles to slide around the hull of
     their target and miss
     it completely.  Like most shields, the Hyperwave
     Nullifier only consumes
     power when it is active.

Nanoshell
     The Nanoshell simply creates a dense barrier of
     Nanoenergons around a ship.
     Few weapons are able to penetrate it.  Like most
     shields, it only consumes
     power when it is active.

Tonklin Motor
     The %s is a weak engine based on an elegant quirk of
     momentum theory.
     It is very inexpensive to construct.

Ion Banger
     The %s sucks in ions from surrounding space and smashes
     them into each
     other at high speeds, creating a propulsive force.  It
     is significantly
     more powerful than the Tonklin Motor.

Graviton Projector
     The %s sprays a gravity field in front of a ship,
     pulling it perpetually
     forward.  The Graviton Projector is more powerful than
     the Ion Banger.

Inertia Negator
     The %s generates an anti-mass field that allows a ship
     to float lightly
     through space.  It is about as strong as the Graviton
     Projector, but it
     consumes much less power.

Nanowave Space Bender
     The %s projects a wide-band field of nanoenergy that
     warps the space around
     a ship, allowing it to slide rapidly in any direction.
     It is a very powerful
     engine.

Tonklin Frequency Analyzer
     The %s scans energy leakages from a ship to determine
     information about its
     status.  Its range is relatively short.  It is always
     active and consumes no
     power.

Subspace Phase Array
     The %s detects subtle variations in the space flow
     around a ship.  It is able
     to detect a ship's status information at short to
     medium range.  It is always
     active and consumes no power.

Aural Cloud Constructor
     The %s is a medium range scanner that projects an aural
     cloud through
     surrounding space, observing vibrations in the cloud to
     detect the status
     of other ships.  It is always active and consumes no
     power.

Hyperwave Tympanum
     The %s is a long range scanner that is able to detect
     the minutest
     variations in the hyperwave ether and analyze them to
     obtain status information
     about other ships.  It is always active and consumes no
     power.

Murgatroyd's Knower
     %s is a very long range scanner that uses a combination
     of advanced
     technologies to determine the status of other ships.
     It is always active and
     consumes no power.

Nanowave Decoupling Net
     The %s harvests coupled nanowaves from surrounding
     space and analyzes them
     to learn the status of other ships.  Its range is
     practically unlimited.  It
     is always active and consumes no power.

Proton Shaver
     The %s is a power generator that operates by extracting
     small quantities
     of protons from heavy atomic nuclei and converting them
     to energy.  It is
     inexpensive but produces little power.

Subatomic Scoop
     The %s sucks subatomic particles from surrounding space
     and converts them
     to energy.  It is a stronger generator than the Proton
     Shaver.

Quark Express
     The %s uses a little-understood technology to squeeze
     energy from various
     sub-subatomic particles.  It is a powerful generator.

Van Creeg Hypersplicer
     The %s merges mixed-frequency hyperwaves and collects
     the energy bleed-off.
     It is a very powerful generator.

Nanotwirler
     The %s puts a stream of Nanoenergons into sympathetic
     resonant motion, and
     channels off the energy they release from each other.
     It generates even
     more power than the Van Creeg Hypersplicer.
