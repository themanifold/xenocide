Finally, after a long break, i'm back to Xenocide. Writing my thesis is almost finished, so I can spend more time on the game :) Today's update base mainly on comments and requests from users. Xenocide had some problems with Linux console (the console is too slow, couldn't manage 15 redraws per second), so I had to do some changes. Linux users complained about CPU usage, so I had to change "wait for key" procedure.

Changes:

- Fixed bug in showing info about things on cell, where player stays.
- Fixed bug - now monsters can't step into stairs, when player is not on the level.
- The game uses much less power of processor when Special FXs are off.
- Difficulty of first levels is better balanced.
- Player can mend armor using the other one as parts.
- Player can ready some weapon to instant wield it.
- Some optimizations (hope without bugs).
- Some minor changes in game's engine.

- Improved AI for animals (they aren't depend on player's sight any more)
- Improved descriptions of combat. Descriptions depend on weapons used.

25.07.03

Next month passed and the month wasn't wasted.

Changes:
- Added advanced AI of intelligent monsters. 
  They decide which weapon and armor is best for them.
  They know how to use range weapons and its ammo
  They try to avoid danger (like fire or traps)
  They cooperate.
  They can use granades, pills and all equipment laying around!
  They try to find hidden enemy.
  They open closed door on their way
  They run away, when enemy is too strong
  They can use some defensive techniques.
  They even don't like to bore for too long!
(These features can be disabled in monster's definition)
- options are saved, you can make a default set.
- new options: auto-aim nearest enemy,
               forbid friendly monsters to swap place with you,
               show cursor on player,
               for slow computers - info that player is stunned and the game calculates.
- thrown items bounce on walls, so granades are not deadly for thrower in narrow corridors.
- a new level type and Genetic Machine moved there.
- a lot of small bugs corrected.
- added 'A' command - attack something near you (like terrain or friendly monster)
- added basic classes (combat, medical, scientific). For now only "combat" is useful.

No, Xenocide is not dead. I'm just completly out of time... :/ This weekend I had a moment, so I made some bugfixes. "Blue levels" are generated fine now, and every place on the
map is reachable. Parser works fine too, so linux version probably wont crash anymore (unfortunaltely I have no time to compile it under linux...)

Well, because Polish language isn't so popular in the world, I've decided to make this website international :) I'm too lazy to translate all the things into two languages, so everything will be in English, espacially News. The poll is working now. You can vote.

Hm... rozmarzy³em siê nad wizj¹ Xenocide zapominaj¹c o pewnych istotnych szczegó³ach implementacyjnych, nad którymi jakiœ czas temu myœla³em. Chodzi mianowicie o losow¹ generacjê "stworzonych przez cz³owieka" poziomów a w³aœciwie niemo¿liwoœæ ich zrobienia... :/ Hm... jednak Xenocide musi pójœæ innym torem. (Mówi³em - nie pytaæ o œwiat gry, mo¿e siê zmieniæ). Ci¹gle zapominam, ¿e roguelike to roguelike...
