# oraz na sloty (uchwyty na bron lub inne przedmioty) (action slot)
# Szybkosc ruchu robota jest obliczana nastepujaco:
# S = suma move power wszystkich "nog"
# W = waga calego robota (powloka, nogi, cpu, bron)
# SPD = S - W/4000
# Wiec szybkosc poruszania sie robota trzeba definiowac jego wag¹
# Szybkosz poruszania sie nie jest rowna szybkosci reakcji, do tego jest CPU i jego szybkosc.
# Szybkosc CPU jest wykorzystywana podobnie jak u zwyklych potworow ich szybkosc

# CPU PROGRAMMING
# Program is a string of characters.
# Program is executed lineary every time from the beginning, on every get_action for robot.
# Executed is the first non-conditional activity
# There are two types of instructions: conditional and non-conditional
# Conditional instructions - when condition is fulfiled, CPU executes next instruction
#  	      		     when condition is not fulfiled, CPU skip the next non-conditional instruction
#			     (instruction pointer moves to the position after the next non-conditional)
# Available instructions:
#
# Conditional
# 0 - If I see the enemy
# 1 - If I stand on position where you last saw enemy
# 2 - If I stand on just by position where you last saw enemy
# 3 - If I are >4 cells from last seen enemy position

# 5 - If my weapon has ammo
# 6 - If I see my creator
# 7 - Coin toss (50% chance)
# 8 - If I can move
# ! - Negate next condition
#
# Non-conditional
# a - go to the last seen creator's position
# b - attack enemy by range weapon
# c - go to last seen enemy position
