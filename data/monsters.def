[MADDOCTOR]
NAME = "Mad Doctor"
CATEGORY = "MONSTER_UNIQUE"
DESCRIPTION = "This genetic lab was once home to a myriad of illegal experiments, all which have gone awry. You have witnessed with your own eyes the horrors that man may forge when he alters nature against the natural order. But all of the horrors you have witness prior to this moment pale in comparison to the terror that now stands before you. This genetic lab was once overseen by a doctor, a mad man who believed himself to be equal to God. Yet he was not omnipotent, and when his own creations turned on him and left him for dead, he was forced to turn to his own twisted science to save himself. In order to save himself he injected into his bloodstream a myriad of mutagenic chemicals, each different chemical containing a sampling of alien DNA. Now he stands before you, no longer recognizable as a man. The DNAs of his experiments have merged with his own, transforming him into a thing that is neither man nor beast. High above you he towers, easily ten feet tall, covered from the waist up by a thin layer of matted, putrid, twisted fur. His arms, thick as tree trunks, each sport a multitude of fingers, while at the end of each finger is a sword-like claw. Below the waist he ceases to resemble a man in the least, his belly terminating in a set of chitinous, spider-esque legs. From out his back protrudes what would appear to be an exoskeletal tail, at the end of which rests a large barb that looks as if it was stripped right off of some immense devil-scorpion. All these things are terrifying, but the feature of the doctor that is most hideous of all is not one of his many bizarre appendages. No, the thing about him that strikes you with greatest dread is his face. Though set into a mass of hideous, inhuman flesh, the doctor's face is very human. It has all the features that one would expect to find in an old, grandfatherly man, but this pleasant face is twisted into a sick grin, and its cold grey eyes burn with an empty and hollow fire. Yes, this was once a man, but regardless of who this man once was, you can see that what he is now, and you know this; he gazed upon you with intent, the intent to kill. The fear swells up inside of your chest as he draws nearer, and you know that you have to make a choice. You can either fight to rid the cosmos of this thing, or you can flee to save your own life. With every passing moment the doctor draws nearer, and so you have to make a choice, and fast. What will you do?"
